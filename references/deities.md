## Septerra: Deities

Very few individuals in Septerra have access to supernatural abilities. Some gain access to Arcane magic through the study of magical reagents. Others, like witches, shamans, and druids, tap into the primal energies and spirits of the lands. A few, rare individuals have access to psionic abilities (Psyionics are a very rare ability, and is significantly diƯerent than any type of magic. See me if interested in playing a Psionic or using the Psychic class).

The most common way people obtain supernatural powers is to follow a Deity who oƯers the powers in exchange for serving them and championing their cause. Below are some of the celestial beings that your character can follow, and that can grant your power.

In this setting, there exists something that the theologians call the 'Decree Passive.' This is the concept that divine beings are limited as to how much direct influence they can exert on the world. Most deities only speak to this realm through whispers and dreams, and their angelic or daemonic followers can only be summoned to this realm for a few hours at a time. In Septerra, while divine beings exist, the fate of the world is left up to mortals.

With the exception of a few, the beings listed below are not inherently good or evil. One kingdom may see a deity as evil, while others may not hold that view. Only those listed as the Prime Evils cannot be selected. The Dark Gods may be taken with permission.

There are a few types of beings / religions your character can follow

- Gods are beings who appeal to members of all races. Note: while the gods are subdivided by category, this is done by theologians, and not by the gods themselves.
- Demi-gods are mortals that a god has raised to a divine status. Most demigods are only followed by members of their own race
- Religions typically don't follow a specific deity but rather may follow a set of spiritual and esoteric beliefs.
- Note: the title 'archangel' is often given to gods of positive, good virtues. 'Archdemon' is usually given to a god of negative virtues. This is a designation given by theologians.

## Religions:

- The Divine Synod: a newer religion that worships Sanguineous, believe to be the god of all positive emotions (as opposed to his nemesis, Lucineous, the god of all negative emotions). Followers of the Snyod believe the other gods and demi-gods derive their power from Sanguineous and are his agents. However, the worship of these gods is considered blasphemy, as he is the only true god.
- Shamanism: Shamanism is belief and worship of nature and the spirits of the wilds. It is not an organized religion, and does not follow any particular deity. Followers usually focus on Primal magics
- Wyccan: an unorganized religion that focus on energy and nature. This religion emphasizes both Primal and Occult magic.
- Tsaoism: this expansive religion has hundred, if not thousands or divine beings, known as Buddah. These can include all of the other gods, demigods, and a wide selection of individuals believe to have accended. Followers of Tsaoism do not follow any specific deity; rather they pray to all of them for wisdom and guidance. Tsaoism is a journey of enlightenment and personal grown, ending with enlightenment.
