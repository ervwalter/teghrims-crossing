  This file details the major organizations, cults, and orders operating in Septerra. It describes their histories, purposes, membership requirements, and influence on the world. Organizations range from martial orders and religious cults to secret societies and druidic circles. The document provides guidance on how player characters can join or interact with these groups, and what benefits or restrictions might apply. This is the primary reference for social structure, alliances, and faction-based play.

## Organizations

Throughout Septerra, there are many martial organizations (gangs, knightly orders, charitable organizations, etc). Typically, these organizations are inwardly focused on the lands and kingdoms they originate from. There are a few, however, that are not limited one area and work among the kingdoms. Your player character can belong to one of these if you wish, and if your character meets certain requirements.

o Children of Death: The Children of Death are an oƯshoot of the church of

Pharasma. Most churches of Pharasma typically concern themselves with their local region, but over the centuries, there have grown small orders who proactively go out into the world seeking and end of the undead menace. The Children of Death originated recently, only in the last two hundred years. The diƯerentiate themselves by their grim, yet festive makeup. This is permanently worn, and is meant to inspire others that death is not to be feared, but is rather the next step in existence. In

between hunting the undead (primarily Husks (skeletons, zombies, etc) and Remnants (ghosts, specters, shades, etc), the children of death also help out locally with funerals, festivals, and other religious ceremonies. Children of Death are active all through out Septerra.

- o Requirement: must be a follower of Pharasma, trained in religion
- o Class: any, but Ceric and Champion are recommended
- o Dwarven Slayer cults. Dwarven slayer cults are an ancient, all male organization

that follow the dwarven demi-god Grimnir. They are usually made up of middle to elder dwarves who are searching for more adventure, even though they are now longer in their youth. Their purpose is to challenge themselves against stronger and stronger monsters, even if it could mean their demise. All slayers seek a glorious death, and dying of old age is unthinkable. In addition to their insane courage, Slayers are also known for wearing little clothing. To a Slayer, every scar and bruise tells a story. It's a record of their adventures. Slayers

rarely stay in Dwarven lands, and eagerly roam the world looking for new monsters to fight. They are happy to drink ale in taverns and tell tales of high adventure.

- o Prerequist: Male dwarf, follower of Grimnir, trained in Athletics
- o Class: must be a marital class; barbarian preferred. Even if they wear armor, it is assumed they are wearing minimal amounts

o Elven Wych Cults. Wych cults are an ancient and all female elven order dedicated

to the Elven demi-god, Morathi. The blood of worthy enemies plays a large part in their religious ceremonies. Only the best blood will do and must be gained from defeating a foe in battle. These rituals heal their wounds and keep them young. While this aspect of their religion should make them unpopular, Wych elves embrace this, and are actually highly respected through out Septerra. Wyches roam the land, going from town to town. They gain the favor

of the locals by putting on festivals, showing oƯ their acrobatic and gladiatorial talents. When they've gained the trust of their hosts, they will see if the town has had any issues with bandits or monsters. They will oƯer to take care of these threats for little to no cost, as long as they can keep the blood of their foes.

 Wyches are derived from ancient elves known as Battle Dancers, and like them, wear only the minimal amounts of armor. For Wyches, this is partially out of vanity, partially to appeal to the men among their hosts, but also to display their martial prowess (to be able to dispatch a foe with out taking a blow).

- o Prerequisite: Female Elf, follower of Morathi, trained in Acrobatics
- o Class: any martial, recommended Monk, Thaumaturge (Wych elves poison their blades with the blood of their slain foes)
- o Death Dealers are followers of Lilith who have oƯered their soul in order to become

instruments of vengeance. If a person has been seriously wronged by another (such as having a family member murdered), the victim can perform the Dark Prayer, where they oƯer their soul to Lilith in exchange for vengeance. If Lilith accepts the Prayer, she tasks one of her Death Dealers, people who have oƯered their soul to her as part of the Dark Sacrament, to kill the perpetrator. Death Dealers receive their training

directly from Lilith in the form of nightmares.

 Depending on which lands they are operating in, Death Dealers may work covertly or openly, depending the local peoples impression of Lilith. For example, in the Iron Kingdoms, Lilith is considered evil, and her followers are outlawed. In the Jade Kingdoms, Lilith is considered part of Yin and Yang; and a part of karma for very bad deeds. While not liked, Death Dealers are tolerated. In other cultures, such as Norn and Delvin Elves (Shadow Elves), Lilith is liked, and her followers walk openly.

o Prerequisite: follower of Lilith, trained in stealth; Class: any

o Lions of Ahlan are a chivalric order from the Iron Kingdoms. While most knightly

orders are focus on protecting their local villages, the Lion of Alhan are active in distant lands. Their aim is to make alliances with other races. They seek to make a positive impression and are diplomats just as much as they are warriors. While most of the order follow one of the three divine guardians as their god, they are not a religious order.

- o Prerequisit: Human from the Iron Kingdon
- o Class: any martial, Fighter, champion recommended

o Black Templars, not playable. Similar to the Lions of Alhan, the Black Templar are

active outside of their own lands. Though they originated in the Iron Kingdom, they have become more active in other human lands. They are followers of the Divine Synod, and have an apostolic zeal for their deity, Sanguineus. They seek to proactively eliminate anything they consider a threat, and are not always know for getting along with other races. They are not playable, as they tend to have an antagonistic relationship with others.

o Drow. See the Possible Ancestries Section of the Ancestry guide. Drow are elves

who follow the elven demi-god Lolth. They are dedicated to the survival of the elven race at any cost, and will take any action to that end. Though generally rare, Drow have been active throughout all of known history, and probably even earlier. Almost all of the remaining elven ancestries owe some part of their survival to the Drow. However, the dark and sinister means that the Drow are willing to go, don't really endear them to others

o Priests of Discord are followers of the goddess Eris. They seek to bring down any

powerful organization (be it ork hoards, strong kings, or overbearing religious organizations). They don't seek anarchy, but rather to prevent the powerful from becoming too powerful. They may work in small groups or solo. Most of their eƯorts are clandestine.

- o Prerequisites: Follower of Eris, trained in Deception
- o Class, any, but rougue, bard, swashbuckler are

recommended.

- o Circle of Orboros are a very loose collection of druids, shammans, witches, and

others who have a strong aƯinity for the natural world. They don't have any real structure or oganization, but are rather more of a support network. Their main goal is to help the civilized world co-exist with nature.

- o Prerequisit: trained in nature
- o Class: any nature alligned class
