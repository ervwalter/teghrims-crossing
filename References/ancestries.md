title: Ancestries
description: |
  This comprehensive file describes the playable ancestries and heritages in Septerra, including humans, elves, dwarves, and a wide array of unique and monstrous races. It covers their cultures, histories, and special backgrounds, as well as the societal roles and challenges faced by each group. The document also discusses how certain monstrous ancestries can be integrated into society, and provides detailed background options for characters with unusual origins. This is the main reference for character ancestry selection and background lore.

#### Ancestries

### Overview:

As the world of Septerra has finally started to open up, there are several races that have become active in the new age of exploration. The following are the main races to do so. Genetically speaking, all ancestries have separate and unique dna. While mixed races don't exist, it is possible to have mixed ancestries. If a human is raised among elves as a young child, they may begin to exhibit elven traits, such as longer ears and more keen vision. As they are still genetically diƯerent than elves, they cannot produce oƯspring with elves, but could with another human.

## Relevancy:

 Next to each ancestry listing is a Campaign Relevance rating (S, A, B, C, D,& F). This indicates how relevant the Ancestry is to the campaign. These are the races who will be most common in the plot, and the one's you most likely to come across. This is not an indication of what you should play, though interacting with members of your own ancestry will be easier than trying to influence members of other ancestries.

Homeland: This is the continent that the Ancestry currently calls home

## Deities:

 This is only an indication of the deities/religions that are the most common among that particular ancestry. However, followers of all of the gods can be found through out most of the kingdoms. Demi-gods are usually tied to an ancestry and rarely worshiped by members of other races.

## Appearance:

 This is only a basic description; hair colors listed are the actual color, not the common colors given to hair (i.e. 'red' hair is often orange in color).

### Languages:

Each ancestry has a listed Ancestral language, as well as a few Secondary languages. These are other languages that are commonly spoken by that race. At character creation, a character knows their ancestral language and common. They can choose one addional language from the secondary languages for each +1 they have to their Intelligence. If a character has a +4 to

their intelligence, they will know all of the secondary languages, and can choose one additional language from the following list:

Common Languages of Septerra:

- Abyssal a rare language spoken by beings from the Void and cults that follow them (requires permission)
- Araneid a language spoken by intelligent spiders and drow
- Aelvish an ancient language still spoken by all Elves
- Cathay Spoken in the Jade Kingdoms and surrounding regions
- Celestial a Latin sounding language spoken by angels, demons, and other being from the divine realm
- Cimmerian a language commonly spoken through out Hyboria
- Coptic A hieroglyphic language from Aegyptus
- Draconic a language of drakes, dragons, kobolds, and dragon kin
- Druidic a language derived Spriggan, but more logical. Spoken by druids (druid class only or by permission)
- Dwemmer an ancient language still spoken by Dwarves
- EƯrit the language of the Edenian ancestries, but has become commonly spoken among sailors due to its ease of learning
- Entish a language spoken by intelligent flora, particularly tree kin and dryads.
- Hurloon spoken by the various Bouvok ancestries
- Imperial commonly spoken in Avenlore
- Necril common among intelligent undead, very common in Astoria
- Gnoblar A language spoken by Goblins
- Grottun a language spoken by Giants, Ogres, Trolls
- Leonish spoken by intelligent cats and Leonin
- Lupine, spoken by intelligent wolves, Wolfen, and ware-creatures
- Orruk A guttural language spoken by Orks
- Parceltounge While many races can understand it, only a few races can speak it: Lizardmen, Nagaji, and Yuatja
- Seaspeak spoken by intelligent aquatic races
- Skald a language spoken by the Norn
- Spiriggan A confusing, nonsensical language spoken by fey, elementals, and other intelligent creatures of nature
- Ysoki a language spoken by intelligent mice and rat people
- Yucatec a language commonly spoken in Primordia

A few notes on Languages:

- Common is a very basic language that is easy to learn but lacks any depth or nuance. It's rather reviled; elves refer to it as 'toilet speak,' and dwarves will only speak it if there are no other options
- When speaking to an NPC, their attitude toward you, and any associated checks will depend on which language you are speaking. Communication in Common is the hardest choice, speaking in a language both parties know is a better choice, and speaking in the NPC's Ancestral language is the most favorable. Charismatic characters are the best choice when speaking in Common, while characters who can communicate in a NPC's Ancestral Language would be a better choice.

## Drune

Though they may look like humans (just physically taller and stronger that humans) there is actually no relation between the two. As far as anyone can tell, the Drune lived in their current homelands far before humans began to move out of Aegyptus into Avenlore. Practitioners of Shamanism, Drune are also martially adept.

## Norn

Relevancy: A Homeland: Solstheim Deities: Morvahna, Crom, Khorn Appearance: white skin, black, light brownish white hair, orange Ancestral Language: Skaald Secondary Languages: EƯrit, Imperial, Aelvish Inspiration: Vikings of lore

The Norn live in their homeland of Solstheim. For ages they have survived as farmers and seafarers. In a period known as the Norn age, they were responsible for seaborn raids against costal cities all over the continents of Lindon, Avenlore, Oceanus, and the Unakmel-duin Aisles. As the races who were the victims of the raids began to stand up for themselves, the Age of the Norn ended, and the Age of the Exploration began. Though once antagonistic, Norn have become quite well known as mercenaries, sailors, and settlers.

#### Celtos

Relevance: B

Homeland: Nock'Maar

Deities: Shamanism, Gia, Morvahna, Crom, Pharasma

Appearance: white skin, brown or orange hair

Ancestral Language: Skaald

Secondary Languages: Imperial, Aelvish, Spriggan

Inspiration: Celts

Sharing the continent of Lindon with the Sylvan elves, the Celtos learned to live in harmony with nature and the forest spirits. They have tended to be more insular than their Norn brethren and have been more reticent to leave their forests. In recent decades, they have had conflicts with settlers from the Iron Kingdoms seeking to move into their lands. While they have begun to open up and explore more of the work around them, they've remained very warry of the towns and cities that would take them away from nature.

# Dhampir

Relevancy A.

Homeland: Varies by Ancestry

Deities: varies, Pharasma is popular

Appearance: may vary upon their primary ancestry

Ancestral Language: Depends on the Dhampir's Ancestry

 Secondary Languages: Depends on the Dhampir's Ancestry, but always includes Necril

 Dhampir originated in Astoria, not long after the conquest of the Vampire. These were originally humans who were bit, but did not fully develop into full vampires. As they were not full vampires, they could move about in full sun, and could easily operate in the world outside of Astoria. Not bound by the Miasma, they fist moved to Avenlore and Orientus under orders of the Vapiric houses. Later they would form their own houses in these lands, and eventually, gain their independence. Most Dhampir are of human origin, though there are some of elven, particularly the Shadow Elves who inhabit the same lands of Astoria. A good number of other races have been brought into Astoria as slaves have also had members who've become Dhampir as well.

 Due to the competition, most Dhampir live outside of Astoria. Most of the Dhampir Houses are in the Iron or Jade Kingdoms. There are a few Houses among the Norn. Inside Astoria, Dhampir of Shadow Elf Ancestry have houses among their elven kin.

Unlike Vampire, Dhampir can have children. Most Dhampir are either born of Dhampir parents, or are a mortal that survived the bite of a vampire, but did not fully transform. There are many Dhampir that are independent, but most Dhampir belong to bloodline Houses. An outsider Dhampir can undergo a blood ritual and be welcomed into a House, forming familiar blood bonds with the other members.

 To other Vampires, Dhampir are known as Half-Bloods; half mortal, half vampire. They are also known as day walkers due to their ability to move freely in daylight. While Dhampir understand the Soul-rot that plagues other Vampire, they do not suƯer from it until the reach old age. Dhampir need to feed on fresh blood (the more intelligent the race, the better), but they do not have to feed as often; usually once every two or three weeks will do. Failure to feed will bring on soul rot and eventually drive them mad if they don't feed.

## Dwarves

 Like Elves, the Dwarves of Septerra once flourished prior to the Dark Times. But unlike the elves, who tried to adapt to the changing world, Dwarves choose to stubbornly resist. While once great, only three dwarven heritages remain; the Highland Clan, Grey-Rock Clan, and Stone-Bearer Clan.

### Highland Clan, aka Mountain Dwarves

Relevancy: S

Homeland: The Tamenroah Highlands in Avenlore

Deities: Highland Dwarves tend to prefer the dwarven demi-gods (Moradin, Sharindlar, Grimnir (among slayers)), but Chronos and Tyrael are popular.

Appearance: Sought, weathered skin, orange, brown, grey hair

Ancestral Language: Dwemmer

Secondary Languages: Imperial, Gnoblar, Orruk

Inspiration: Scottland, Tolkien Dwarves

 Highland Clan Dwarves stubbornly clinging to their lands in the Tamenroah Highlands, located in South Eastern Avenlore. Through Grit and determination, they have slowly grown in strength. In recent times, they have begun relations with the Iron Kingdoms. Such was the devastation of the Dark Times, that they have little knowledge of the dwarves that came before them. While they have been interested in starting trade, they have also had a strong

interest in exploring ancient dwarven sites, as well as making connections with the other surviving dwarven heritages.

### Grey-Rock Clan, aka Duergar.

Relevancy: A, B

Homeland: Unak'Mel-Duin

Deities: Duergar tend to prefer the dwarven demi-gods (Moradin, Sharindlar, Grimnir (among slayers))

Appearance: Stout, grey, weathered skin, white hair

Ancestral Language: Dwemmer

Secondary Languages: Skald, EƯrit, Cathay

Inspiration: Grey Joy house from Game of Thrones

 The Grey-rock clan are named for the Unakmel-duin Aisles in which they live. This harsh, storm ravaged chain of islands has been their home for as long as any of them know. Known for having a disposition that align with their environment, they have been slow to open up to other races. Norn raiders and Drow slavers have left centuries old grudges. Despite relying heavily on their fleets for fishing, the though of opening up to trade has been met with resistance.

#### Stone-Bearer Clan, aka Hill Dwarves

Relevancy D

Homeland: Hyboria, Kel-Duin Mountains, X6

Deities: Stone-Bearer Dwarves tend to prefer the dwarven demi-gods (Moradin, Sharindlar, Grimnir (among slayers))

Appearance: stout, tanned skin, brown hair.

Ancestral Language: Dwemmer

Secondary Languages: Cimmerian, Orruk, Hurloon

Located in the Kel-duin mountains, on the south east region of Hyboria, the Stone-Bearer clan is the only kingdom on Hyboria to have survived any length of time. Living above the land, and in their Dwarven halls below, they have always had a place they can seek refuge, no matter what hazard came their way. Life on Hyboria still remains diƯicult, even so long removed from the Dark Times. While the Stone-Bearer Clan would like to increase their contact with their dwarven brethren, survival at home still remains a top priority.

# Edenians

 Edenians are a group of ancestries that are believed to have originated from other mystical realms. These are now trapped on Septerra. As they no longer have access to their realm of origin, the souls of these races are bound to this realm, and create some peculiarities with how they die and are reborn. While they are often put into the Edenian group, the ancestries listed below may have nothing in common with each other.

## Fetchling

 Relevancy: B Homeland: Astoria, X10 Deities: Aris, Teclis, Stendarr Appearance: light grey skin with black or white hair Ancestral Language: EƯrit Secondary Languages: Necril, Lupine, Draconic

 Fetchlings are a mysterious race. It's thought that they have some tie to another plain or existence. It's unknown why, but the Fetchling population appears to have some sort of maximum number (only around 30,000). When the population is near the cap, no new Fetchlings can be born.

They live in the southern mountains of Astoria. Like the Delvin Elves, they are not aƯected by the Miasma. Unlike the Delvin, they have not been pursued as aggressively by the vampire clans as Fetchling blood is inedible by vampires, and can even be mildly toxic to them. Fetchling can not be turned into Vampires.

The mountain cities of the Fetchling are ancient and have grown opulent over time. While there are few reasons for Fetchlings to leave their cities, some do more out of a sense of adventure than any other reason.

### Changeling

Relevancy: D Homeland: Varies Deities: may vary by the region they are born Appearance: pale, white skin, white eyes, white hair Ancestral Language: Depends on primary ancestry Secondary Languages: varies by ancestry, but always includes EƯrit

Changelings are one of the most enigmatic races in Septerra. Scholars debate if they are really a race at all and are more of a common occurring arbitration. They are not born to changeling families, but rather, almost at random, when a members of another ancestry has a child, it will be born as a pale skinned, black eyed child, which has become known as a changeling. These have no resemblance to the parents who birthed them. While this is odd for the parents, Changelings are often seen as a good luck charm. For some unknown reason, Changelings mature much faster than their siblings. They can learn skills, trades, and languages supernaturally fast, almost as if they had prior knowledge of it.

Changelings are fairly rare, but as they mature fast, they often move away from their parents at an relatively early age. Many are taken to wandering throughout Septerra, as if they know the land, but have no memory of it.

 Changelings can not bear children, and many theologians believe that they are tied to a loop of being reincarnated. While they have no memory of their prior lives, some of the skills they learned in prior lives can be re-learned in short order.

## Tiefling

Relavancy: C

Homeland: A chain of islands of the east cost of Hyboria X11

Deities: Trigon, Aris, Wee Jas

Appearance: Caucasian to red skin, horns, varying hair color

Ancestral Language: EƯrit

 Secondary Languages: May choose any of the other languages, even special languages such as Thieves Cant or Druidic.

 Tieflings have a very small population compared to the other races. While they live on a series of small islands oƯ the east coast of Hyboria, these are not believed to be their homelands. No one really knows where they came from. The earliest known appearance of Tieflings was near the end of the Dark Times.

While tieflings have long lives (comparable to elves and dwarves) they don't' have many children. Most tiefling couples have trouble conceiving. Despite their small population, they have been active as seafarers (both as pirates and merchants). Tieflings also seem to have a supernatural ability to learn new languages.

## Elves

 From the sheer number of ruins scattered all throughout Septerra, it's know that the elves must have possessed great kingdoms at one time. As the Dark Times dominated one millennia after another, the elven races barely survived. Drawn into deeper and darker places, the elven race survived by adapting to hostile environments where not even monsters would thrive. By the end, only three heritages, the Sylvan, Delvan, and Eladrin had survived in any significant form, while two other, the Gelvin and Aurorin, barely surviving.

Sylvan aka Wood Elves

Relevancy: B

Homeland: Tir Asleen

Deities: Sylvanos, Morathi, Mystra, Gia, Shamanism

Appearance: Caucasian skin with brown or yellow hair

Ancestral Language: Aelvish

Secondary Languages: Spriggan, Skald, Entish

Inspiration: Wood Elves from Tolkien

 During the Dark Times, the Wood Elves survived in the dark forests of Lindon. In the time following, their population has grown. While they have grown in peace with their Celtos neighbors, their relations with the Iron Kingdoms has been strained

### Delvin, aka Shadow Elf or Grey Elf

Relevancy: A

Homeland: Astoria; Dark Astoria X3

Deities: Sylvanos, Morathi, Lilith, Avacyn, Wyccan

Appearance: Grey skin with reddish hair, sometimes purple, or white

Ancestral Language: Aelvish

Secondary Languages: Araneid, Necril, Lupine

 Shadow Elves once found refuge in the continent of Astoria. They have even built an immunity to the Miasma, which prevents others from leaving. They may have survived the Dark Times in good fashion, had it not been for the arrival and conquest of the Vampire clans. Since then, they have been pushed almost to extinction. Now, they survive in the tall, gothic forest of a region known as Dark Astoria. Clinging to survival, they now seek to establish trade and relations with those outside of Astoria.

### Eladrin (aka High Elves) and Celadrin

Eladrin

Celadrin

Relevancy: D

Homeland: Eladrin: Moonshae Isles; Celadrin Hyboria

Deities: Sylvanos, Morathi, Teclis, Tyrael

Appearance: Eladrin have white skin with light yellow, white hair. Celadrin usually have brown skin with black, blond, or brown hair

Ancestral Language: Aelvish

Secondary Languages: Hyborian, Seaspeak, EƯrit

Inspiration: Tolkien Elves, High Elves from Warhammer

 Sometime in the middle of the Dark Times, Elves began to inhabit the Moonshae Isles, not far from the coats of Hyboria. The quickly gained dominion, and did quite well for the remainder of the Dark Times. While they were able to drive out any threats, they were not able to build much of a kingdom due to the relatively small size of the Isles. Any attempts of theirs to expand into other lands were all met with disaster. Their seafaring skills are one of the contributing factors to this new age of exploration.

 Shortly following the end of the Dark Times, the Eladrin were able to establish small colonies on Hyboria. Elves who were raised in these colonies developed brown skin and are often called Celadrin.

### Aurorin, aka Frost Elves

Relevancy D

Homeland: Frerheim X12, a vast frozen land north of Solstheim

Deities: Sylvanos, Morathi, Stendarr

Appearance: pale white skin, white or light blue hair

Ancestral Language: Aelvish

Secondary Languages: Skaald, Lupine, Gnoblar

 Frost Elves etched out a place to live in the far Norther forests, near the north pole. Over time, they have gained tremendous resistance to the cold, and can wear minimal clothing in the harsh cold and still survive. However, this resistance to cold has made their society lopsided. The resistance to cold develops when a child reaches adulthood. As female Frost Elves enter adulthood a few decades earlier then males do, the survival rates for females is much higher. This is quite detrimental to a race that already has a small population. Frost Elves rarely leave their lands.

#### Gelvin, aka Elflings

Relavancy, F

Homeland: Primordia, West of the Slaan lands X8

Deities: Gia, Shamanism, Orpheus

Appearance: small elves, usually under 4ft tall. White skin, brown or yellow hair

Ancestral Language: Aelvish

Secondary Languages: Yuacatek, Entish, Spriggan

 Only about half the size of other elves, Elflings found a niche in the deep jungles of Illuxtira. While they have begun relations with Slaan and Obsidian Empires, they have been slow to explore outside of their forests. Only in very recent times have they re-established relations with the other elven races.

# Halflings

Relevance: C

Homeland: Varies

Deities: Shamanism, Mystra, Orpheus

Appearance: short, barefoot humanoids with curly brown hair

 Ancestral Language: Depends on which lands they're from. May be Aelvish, Dwemmer, Imperial, or Skaald

Secondary Languages: Entish, Gnoblar, Spriggan

Inspiration: Hobbits from Tolkien

 Halflings are an ancestry of small peoples who have survived throughout history by forming synergistic relations with other races. An extreme love and skill with farming and agriculture has endured them to other races. This symbiotic relationship sees them able to provide food and farm goods in exchange for protection.

 Halflings are mostly known for co-existing with Highland Dwarves, Sylvan elves, both Norn ancestries, and humans of the Iron Kingdoms. Halflings who live among the dwarves and elves are referred to as Gnomes, while those who live among humans and Norn are known as Hobbits. A Halflings love of the land and things that grow tend to make them more insular, though from time to time, some are know to leave their shires and explore the world.

## Humans

Little is known about humans prior to the Dark Times. The lands of Aegyptus, once a mostly baren desert, thrived during the Dark Times. So much so, that humans had begun to colonize areas outside of Aegyptus. When the Dark Times ended, humans had a foot up on the other Ancestries.

## The Iron Kingdoms

Relevancy: S

Homeland: Avenlore, Rügen Länder X1

Deities: Talos, Isis, Stendarr, Divine Snyod

Appearance: Caucasian/European with brown, yellow hair

Ancestral Language: Imperial

Secondary Languages: Orruk, Hurloon, Dwemmer

Inspiration: Mediaeval to Renaissance Europe, particularly Prussian.

Once a colony of the Aegyptyian Kingdoms, the Iron Kingdoms have slowly grown into a kingdom of their own. Having learned metalworking from the Dwarves, Humans of the Iron Kingdoms have developed a love of Iron working and metallurgy. The Iron Kingdoms is a vast land, made up of hundreds of small kingdoms and principalities. While there is a lot of political friction, the Iron Kingdoms has been instrumental in exploration and restarting trade with far oƯ races.

#### The Jade Kingdoms

Relevancy: A Homeland: Shangdu Deities: Tsaoism Appearance: Asian with black hair Ancestral Language: Cathay Secondary Languages: EƯrit, Ysoki, Grottun Inspiration: Asian cultures, particularly Japanese, Chinese, and Korean

Also one of the colonies of the Aegyptian Kingdoms, the Jade Kingdoms have thrived in this new age. While it is made of hundreds of kingdoms, only about half are on the continent. The other half from an island chain, just oƯ the coast.

Like the Iron Kingdoms, the Jade Kingdoms had an early start when the Dark Times ended. They've grown quickly, and now play a major role in trade and exploration.The primary language of the Jade Kingdome is Tsaoism, which sees the gods and demi-gods as some of many divine beings who oƯer wisdom and guidance on the road to inner perfection.

### The Obsidian Kingdoms

Relevancy: D Homeland: Primordai, Yuactec Peninsula X7 Deities: Gia, Appearance: Tan skin, brown hair Ancestral Language: Yucatec Secondary Languages: Orruk, Ysoki, Entish Inspiration: Maya and Inca Civilizations

Located in the jungles of Illuxtria, it's thought that the human presence here may even pre date the Aegyptian Kingdoms. While humans have existed here for a very long time, the hostile environment has made it such that their populations have never grown very high. In recent times, they have grown in enough strength to begin trade with far oƯ lands.

#### The Sand Kingdoms

Relevancy: C Homeland: Aegyptus Deities: Isis, Pharasma, Helios Appearance: Tan to brown skin, black hair Ancestral Language: Coptic Secondary Languages: Lupine, Araneid, Leonish Inspiration: Ancient Egypt

Along with the Kul-Mat, humans of the region held kingdoms that reigned for ages. With the end of the Dark Times and the Burgeoning, the grasslands of Aegyptus have slowly been reclaimed by the desert. Though a former shadow of its former glory, the Aegyptian kingdoms still remain relevant in trade and esteem.

## Leonen

The Leonen are a cat like people found in the southern hemisphere of Septerra. There is evidence that they held sizable kingdoms prior to the Dark Times, though no where as large as the other know people of that time.

#### Romanus

 Relevancy: D Homeland: Romanus Deities: Orpheus, Teclis, Tyrael Appearance: Bipedal lions, white or yellow fur Ancestral Language: Leonish Secondary Languages: Coptic, Hurloon, EƯrit Inspiration: Greco-Roman empires, cat people

 The Romanus lands exists to the far south of the land of the Aegyptians. During the Dark Times, they were pushed to the edge of extinction on several occasions. In recent centuries, they have begun to rebuild their kingdom, and is probably the largest single kingdom in Septerra. However, they are geographically isolated, and their expansion into new lands has been slow. Still, in this new age of exploration, they have begun to seek new trading partners, and explore lands beyond their own.

#### Khajit

Relevancy: D Homeland: Kailasha Deities: Tsaoism, Dibella Appearance: Bipedal tiger and leopard Ancestral Language: Leonish Secondary Languages: EƯrit, Oceanus, Seaspeak Inspiration: Khajit from Skyrim, Hindu culture

The Khajit survived the Dark Times in their ancestral homelands, much like the Leonen did. Unlike the Romonus, they have not formed a unified kingdom, and remain a patchworks of small principalities. This is mostly due to the hostile nature of Bar-Achi. A tropical jungle with large seasonal monsoons, it's a verdant land with danger around every tree. Many jokingly refer to is as the only place on Septerra where the Dark Times did not end. Most Khajit live on the coast or inland rivers, and have forged strong ties with other seafaring peoples. Any progress they've made in taming the jungle as been very slow.

It's believed that the Khajit have inhabited Bar-Achi for a very long time, perhaps even back to the era's before the Dark Times. Littered through out the jungle are the remains of ancient Khajit cites, temples, and settlements. Underneath all of the undergrowth, it's hard to know how much Khajit history lies buried. In recent times, expeditions into the deep jungles have become popular for archeologists and treasure seekers. Some Khajit have begun to

explore beyond their lands, but on the whole, they have remained focused inward.

# Lycans

No one knows the exact origin of the Lycan race. It's thought that they are descended from ancient Drune who merged with animal spirits. Lycans posses the ability to shift between the form of a large human/Norn and that of an animal, typically a fox or wolf. There are three variations: the Wolf-kin, Kitsune (aka Fox Kin), and Were-kin. Kitsune and Wolf-kin have the ability to change their form at will. Their ancestries grow though having oƯspring, as most other races do. Were-kin are often considered to be cursed, and can only change forms under a full moon or other high stress conditions. They spread through being bit, much like vampirism does.

With the exception of the Artic packs, most Wolf-kin are bound by the miasma to remain in Astoria. Were-kin were mostly found in Astoria, but they curse has been slowly expanding out of its boarders. Due to their antagonistic nature, Wolf-kin and Were-kin are not playable.

### Kitsune, aka Fox-kin

Relevancy: A, B Homeland: Shangdu, X4 Deities: Luna, Tsaoism, Mystra Appearance: Similar to Humans but with fox ears and tail(s) Ancestral Language: Lupine Secondary Languages: Cathey, Entish, Spriggan

Kitsune inhabit a mountainous, bamboo forest located in Oceanus. They live not to far from the Jade Kingdoms, and small Kitsune colonies have sprung up among them. Given to peaceful co-existence with their surroundings, Kitsune tend to be inward focused. However, due to wanderlust or a curious nature, some Kitsune do take to adventuring to explore the world around them.

Kitsune have a love of nature, and a particular interest in the stars, astrology, and the moon. They are not as large as other Lycans. They can shift between the form of a fox and that of a human with fox ears and one (or more) tails.

### Khem-ri

Relevancy: C Homeland: Astoria Deities: Isis, Helios, Luna, Stendar Appearance: Humanoid jackals with black fur Ancestral Language: Lupine

Secondary Languages: Coptic, Hurloon

Along with humans, Khem-ri ruled Aegyptus for thousands of years during the dark times. Unlike humans, the Khem-ri have not moved far beyond their ancestral lands. In more recent times, they still prefer to stay in Aegyptus, though wanderlust has compelled some to take to exploring the larger world.

# Nagaji

Relevancy: B

Homeland: Golgorun plains X5, south of Astoria

Deities: Celestine, Wee Jas, Chronos

Appearance: Similar to Humans, but with scale like skin and serpentine noses

Ancestral Language: Parceltounge

Secondary Languages: Oceanus, Cimerrian, Draconic

 Inspiration: a snakelike humanoid race with an Ottoman, Persian esthetic

 Nagaji are a race that went extinct long ago. About four hundred years ago, a clutch of Nagaji eggs that were magically preserved was awakened in the mountains near the Golgorun plains. The newly emerged Nagaji took refuge in some abandoned forts on the plain. Over time their population grew, and they soon set up a harbor that became a destination for sea trade in the region. Their small kingdom has become a major player in the southern trade route connecting Oceanus to Avenlore. It's ports also have begun to draw in trade from Hyboria and Aegyptus.

 The Nagaji are also one of the few races to have contact with Primordia. Early in their re-awakening, they came in contact with Slaan travelers who were sent to their lands after receiving a mystic vision. The Slaan taught them Parceltounge, and have formed a strong bond with them, often serving as protectors and advisors to the fledgling race.

In time, more clutches of magically preserved eggs have been found. Though this added to their population, it remains fairly small. Though not known as mercenaries, Nagaji explorers have been active around Oceanus and Avenlore as they search for other clutches lost in time.

# Orks

 The ork hoards remain one of the primary antagonists all throughout Septerra. Simple minded, orks have a driving urge to fight, wage war, and conquer others. If an ork remains passive for too long, they can grow sick, and even pass away. While the typical ork is not available to be played, there are two distant relative of orks that are: the Oskin and the Yautja. Time and distance has made these races far less feral and capable of making relations with the other organized societies around them.

### Oskin, aka half orks

Relevancy: C

Homeland: Hyboria

Deities: Khorn, Shamanism

Appearance: Tall and muscular humanoids with green skin; hair varies

Ancestral Language: Orruk

Secondary Languages: Cimmerian, Gnoblar, Hurloon

 Oskin clans live in Hyboria, but unlike the Stone-Bearer Dwarves, they've not been able to establish a set homeland. Constantly having to weave the constant dangers, they've survived as a nomadic race. They bear a deep grudge against their ork ancestors due to the never-ending conflicts against them. Due to their size and physical prowess, they make good mercenaries and sailors. Despite having a relatively low population, it's not uncommon to see an Oskin thorough out Septerra.

#### Yautja, aka Hunters, Predators

Relevance: C

Homeland: The deep jungles of Primordia X9

Deities: The Hunt, Lilith, Khorn

Appearance: tall and muscular humanoid with distinctive faces. Braded dark brown or black hair

Ancestral Language: Parceltounge

Secondary Languages: Orruk, Yucatec, Ysoki

Inspiration: Predator movies, Mandalorians from Star Wars

 Yautja separated from the ork race far before the Oskin did. They have become so far removed that their faces no longer resemble their ork ancestors, though they still retain their size. The Yautja created a society deep in the jungles of Illuxtria.

 The Yautja developed an orderly civilization based on a set of beliefs known as 'The Hunt.' This is a set of beliefs centered around martial improvement with hunting, stalking and trophy taking playing a major role. The purpose being to test one's self against stronger and more menacing prey. This belief does not prevent them from following other gods or demi-gods, as long the deities beliefs do not interfere with the Hunt. Some popular gods among the Yautja include Khorn, Aris, and Lilith (whose followers follow the 'Dark Hunt). In the dense, danger filled forests of Primordia, the Yautja had the prey they would need to pursue their Hunt.

Nearly a century ago, a mysterious event lead to the abandonment of their main reliquary and temple. At one time this temple complex housed thousands of trophies and legendary artifacts. It played a central role in binding their society. Then, one day, it went silent. When neighboring tribes investigated, they found the place completely abandoned. The complex was devoid of life; all of the relics had disappeared as well. No one really knows what happened. There were no signs of an attack, nor unusual tracks in the vicinity. The complex is now a ghost town; any who try to delve deep into its grounds returns alive. To further deepen the mystery, the lost artifacts have been found all throughout Septerra.

The event destroyed the one thing that bound their peoples together. The Yautja have slowly begun to leave their homeland and scatter about Septerra. Over time, they've broken into three factions: the Reclaimers, the Wanderers, and the Rebuilders.

 The Reclaimers seek to recover the artifacts that have disappeared from the temple. They do this in the belief that by returning them, the curse on the temple will end, and their race can reunite. They've been willing to interact and work with the other intelligent races of Septerra. Prior to the event, these races would have been considered 'prey,' and beneath interacting with. The Reclaimers are the only playable faction.

The Rebuilders seek to build a new temple somewhere else in Septerra. They continue to see other races as prey and have no interest in working with them. The Wanderers have given up hope of unifying their race, and roam throughout Septerra pursuing the Hunt and nothing else. Both the Rebuilders and Wanderers are antagonists.

## Slaan

 Relavancy: D Homeland: Southern Primordia X8 Deities: Shamanism, Gia, Pharasma Appearance: Bipedal lizards Ancestral Language: Parceltounge Secondary Languages: Yucatan, Seaspeak, Draconic Inspiration: Lizardmen form Warhammer

 Ruins belonging to the Slaan ancestors can be found all throughout the world, generally in tropical areas. Even lands as far away as Hyboria an d Bar-Achi have ruins. Though maybe not as prominent as the Elves and Dwarves of the Pre-Dark Times, there is little doubt that the Slaan played an important roll in that world. However, the Dark Times were also not kind to them, and now they are a much smaller race. The dense jungles of Primordia are the only lands they call home.

 It has only been in the last century, after a chance encounter with the Nagaji, that the Old Ones (the ancient leaders of the Slaan) have given their blessing for the Slaan to leave their lands. Some Slaan have taken to helping the Nagaji in their growing lands, while others explore the world to learn more about their lost legacy.

# Possible Ancestries

The following are allowed but see me as there may be certain restrictions and requirements.

 Leshy: Leshy are awakened, sentient plant creatures, and are not a race per se. Some are a plant given intelligence by a witch or druid to serve as their familiar, or a plant that one day simply became intelligent. Though generally rare, most are aware of their existence. As they tend to be friendly and helpful, they are often welcomed into agricultural communities.

Sprite / Fairy / Pixie: These are immortal creatures of nature. While they may have existed forever, they have a very short (and confused) memory. Whimsical and nonsensical, these creatures are known to follow adventurers out of curiosity. However, they don't' tend to feel any strong reason to be involved in the world of mortals unless there is an imminent threat.

These creatures are diƯerentiated by their wings: fairies have butterfly like wings; Pixies wings are more dragonfly like, while sprites don't have any wings.

Goblins, Kobolds, and Skaven: As far as monsters go, these tend to be lower on the pecking order. Despite their size, all three are known to be sneaky, conniving, and sadistic. However, over time, small groups of them have broken away from rest of their race, and formed small groups that live on the outskirts of the more 'civilized' races. They usually form symbiotic relationships, them providing menial labor and services in exchange for protection and food. Though they've lost the more evil tendencies of their wild cousins, they are still fairly chaotic, and have not fully integrated into their host societies.

 Small goblin communities have sprung up in the Iron Kingdoms and among the Norn. Kobold communities can be found on the outskirts of cities in Hyboria. Skaven have formed symbiotic communities in the Jade Kingdoms.

Drow: Drow are followers of the demigod Lolth. They are dedicated to the survival of the elven race at any cost (commonly through assassination, or manipulation). Many a time has a ravaging ork hoard veared oƯ from elven lands after hearing rumors of wealth amougn the human realms, or a powerful Barron turns up dead, leaving his children to argue amongst themselves rather that invade elven lands. For centuries, the drow took slaves and oƯered to the vampires of Astoria in exchange for leaving the Delvin (shadow elves) alone.

 Anyone (mostly elves) can become a drow. After being found worthy, they are bitten by a dryder, spun into a cocoon for months, and undergo all sorts of archaic rituals. In time, they emerge as an elf with dark grey, black, or dark blue skin and white hair. Drow can not have children, and new Drow are only added through this ritual.

Hyborian: The continent of Hyboria is a vast and ancient full of mineral wealth. Ancestries from all over Septerra can be found in Hyboria. With permission, it is possible to play any ancestry, but using Hyboria and the ancestral land.

title: Ancestries


There are a good number of intelligent ancestries who simply do not get along well with the more orderly ancestries. Perhaps due to genetic disposition or their societal norms, they just don't get along with other races, and play an antagonistic role in the world. However, if removed from their race at an early age, and raised among the 'civilized' races, they can adapt to their new environment, and learn to co-exist. To play on of these races does require permission, and would require to take one of the following backgrounds: Adjunct to a Wych Cult, Scion of Nobility, and a Pressganged Seafarer.

Minotaur and Centaur: Both of these ancestries are a part of the larger Bouvok race. The Bouvok are known for being fiercely territorial, and warry of outsiders. Though not known for being evil, they are very aggressive toward non Bouvok. When taken away from their people at an early age, Minotaur and Centaurs are actually quite adaptable at living among other races.

Minotaur are most commonly taken from their race by orks, who use them guardians of their loot stash. Orphaned minotaur are often taken in by Wych Cults where they become main attractions in their performances, or by sailors who appreciate their raw strength. Minotaur raised with such groups have become known for their loyalty and dependability.

Centaurs are not usually taken from their race, but young and sickly centaur who can not keep up with their herd migrations are often left behind and abandoned. These are often rescued by druids and adopted by communities with a lot of livestock. Such Centaur are known for as good shepherds and guardians.

Gnoll and Hobgoblin: in the wild, both of these races are known for their extreme brutality and sadism. Usually members of these races are killed on site. However, mainly in Hyboria, orphaned children of these races are often taken in. Though these children still retain a good bit of their wild nature, they can adapt enough to live among their adopted race. They have a good reputation as warriors, mercenaries and soldiers.

# Special Backgrounds

Adjunct to a Wych Cult: Wych Cults roam all through out Septerra seeking the blood of worthy adversaries. This blood is key to their religion following the demigod Morathi.
