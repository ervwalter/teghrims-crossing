## Campaign Guide

Campaign Rules: this campaign will be using the following rules

- Ancestry Paragon (gain extra ancestry feats)
- Limited Stamina
- No coin Weight
- No XP to level (leveling will be based oƯ of campaign progress)
- Only oƯicial Paizo rules that have been play-tested will be allowed.
- We'll be using the remastered rules. When possible, they will take precedence over prior rules.

Character Creation. You can create your character using standard character creation rules.

- Please make your decisions with long-term planning in mind. I will have a mechanic for re-training an aspect of your character (see the Activity Point section), but you will not be able to change all the time. Partially this is because I may be planning story points and gear around your character, which will be made more complicated if they are changing all of the time.
- Any options that are uncommon or rare will need to be approved by me; I'm fine with most options. I want to make sure they fit the campaign.
- As this is a custom campaign, you will need to enter your own deity, languages, and some lore skills in to HeroLab.
- Your race needs to use either your ancestry or heritage. Remember, there are no mixed races (half races) in this world. You may choose to a Mixed Ancestry or Versatile Heritage, but these only aƯect the rules for your character.
	- o For example, a character with and Elf ancestry and Tiefling heritage could either be full elf that has some additional rules, or a full Tiefling with some additional rules
	- o If a versatile heritage give a characteristic that the race wouldn't have, it may need to be re-skinned. For example, an elf with a Tiefling heritage would have access to feat that give it horns and a tail. As these are not normal for an elf, the feat would need to be modified so that they make sense for an elf
	- o The only exception to this rule is Dhampirs, who are both a Dhampir and their Ancestral race
- The following rules apply for this campaign:
- o All Kitsune have two forms: a humanoid form with fox ears and a tail and a fox form
- o Khem'ri use a re-skinned version of the Minotaur rules
- o The Psychic class is renamed Warlock. Psychics in this world are rare, and psychic energy works totally diƯerently than magic does. The rules for the Psychic class don't work with the world setting. See me if you're interested in playing an actual psychic.
- o Gunslinger is only allowed under certain circumstances. Black powder weapons do not exist in this world
- Depending on how fast we move, I anticipate being around level 10 by the end of the campaign
- The campaign will run for a year. If not done in 12 months, it will wrap up in the next few sessions

## Campaign Specific Rules

- Days of rest: characters need to spend at least 2 days a week in a secure location (Tegrhim's Crossing is the only place), and doing non-adventure-related activities (i.e., no potion making, armor repairing, scroll making, etc). The campaign isn't set to a timer, so there is plenty of time to take extra days oƯ if needed
	- o A player can choose what recreational activity they wish to do on their day oƯ. Some activities, like a day of prayer or spending a day with one of the Dramatis Persona may have special significance.
- Character improvement: there will be some ability to earn an extra archetype feat, extra lore, extra language, and an extra lore feat tied to their deity. The rules for these are below
- Action Tokens. Starting at level 2 and each level thereafter, payers will earn 1 Action Token. A player can spend an Action Token on one of their downtime days. These actions are significant actions. A player could look at starting a business, find a mate/get married, improve their standing with one of the Dramatis Personae (see below), spend the day in prayer, or any other action a player can think up
	- o Players may also investigate. If there was something a character wants to learn more about, they can research it. This shows interest in that topic, and may lead to further quests relating to it.
	- o A player can only have two Action Tokens at a time.
	- o Depending on how they are being used, and how overwhelmed I feel, additional Action Tokens may be given out.
- o An Action Token uses up a full downtime day
- Dramatis Personae: in the campaign there are a select group of individuals that are the main characters. All other NPCs are considered Lesser Dramatis Personae.
	- o A player can spend a downtime day with a Dramatis Personae character and may get a chance to learn something about the (likes, dislikes, languages and skills they may be able to teach.
	- o All Dramatis Personae start with a neutral attitude toward the party members, and are neither inclined to help or hinder them
	- o Their attitude starts at neutral and can be raised to friend, good friend, and best friend
	- o Starting at level 2, a player spend an Action Token to improve their standing with the Dramatis Personae. They receive a +1 for each downtime day they hung out with the Dramatis Personae (up to a +3). If they fail, you don't loose the action token, you just have to try again the following week. Any bonus due to time spend with the Dramatis Personae will reset
	- o A player can be friends with all of the Dramatis Personae, and it is advised that each Dramatis Personae is a friend with at least one player.
	- o A player can only reach good friend and best friend with one Dramatis Personae.
	- o At level 2, players can start becoming friends. At level 5 they can try for good friend, and level 8 for best friend.
	- o The first time a player becomes a friend, good friend, and best friend, they will earn a skill point. This skill point can be used to learn a bonus language, lore skill, and archetype feat (each of these bonuses can only be learned once). To spend a skill point, the player must find a Dramatis
	- o Personae capable of teaching it and is at least considered a friend.
	- o Each Dramatis Personae has a secret. This could be a personal flaw, a traumatic past event, something their ashamed of, etc. Starting at level 6, a player who spends a day with their good friend can attempt to guess what the secret is. Once they've learned it, they can attempt to do something nice for the Dramatis Personae.
- Days of Prayer. Characters can spend their downtime in prayer or religious activities for their deity. After spending three days (doesn't have to be consecutive) the player earns an Augury Token.
	- o After performing a 10 minute ritual to their deity, a player can ask a question of their deity as per the D&D 5e spell of the same name
	- o A player can only have 1 Augury Token at a time.

o Once a player has earned and spent at least 3 Augury Tokens, they can spend an Action Token to spend a day in prayer and learn the lore skill of their deity.
