# Session Summary 2025-05-16

## Session Overview

The party—comprised of newcomers from far-flung corners of Septerra—converged at a caravan hub and joined a dangerous trade route headed toward Teghrim's Crossing. The session featured organic character introductions, challenging overland travel, battles against beast and goblin ambushes, and the forging of initial bonds around the campfire. The party concluded the session arriving at the iconic bridge settlement of Teghrim's Crossing.

## Story Developments

The session opened with each player character—**Qotal**, **Arnór Josefson**, **Aurelia**, and **Bruldin Grimstone**—introduced separately, each starting their journey from distant regions. Qotal, a Slaan monk from the Jade Kingdoms, journeyed within a trade caravan where he met the congenial and mysterious NPC, Lynn. Meanwhile, Arnór Josefson, a Norn witch, set sail from Solstheim on a Norn grain ship. Alongside him was Sylvia, a well-armed and noble-seeming human from a distinguished family. Bruldin Grimstone, a Duergar barbarian, waited in the newly-built port city of Menoth-Derith, a coastal, wild-west-feeling hub, where he encountered both Norn and Duergar sailors. Tensions from a not-so-distant history of raids between their peoples lingered in the air, but mutual respect prevailed.

Over several days, smaller groups converged and ultimately joined a west-bound caravan aiming for Teghrim's Crossing—an important trading post on the border between orc and human lands. NPCs such as Sylvia and Lynn also joined the party. Traveling east, the party and their caravan dealt with the constant threat of monsters and bandits, shown in tense, largely silent days of travel and moments of rest at fortified caravanserais.

An early challenge arose when the caravan encountered a herd of aggressive auroch (giant bison). The party tried a combination of brute force, intimidation, survival skills, and even music to fend off the creatures. Meanwhile, Aurelia spent time alone in an abandoned caravanserai, dealing with a trio of snotling (young goblin) intruders—dispatching them when threatened and harvesting their blood to replenish her dhampir needs.

Upon arrival at a caravan rest stop, new introductions were made, and the party was asked by the caravan master to take up rear guard duties in exchange for passage and payment. They fortified defenses, enhanced goblin-scaring wards, and set traps for the night, while several party members conversed and shared bits of background and motivation during the first campfire gathering.

The party's makeshift fortifications were soon tested by a midnight goblin intrusion, followed by a parley and then pitched battle with a sizable orc and his goblin followers. Working together, the party ultimately overcame the attackers, though some were brought to the brink of unconsciousness. With minor NPC healing, the group recovered and pressed forward on their journey.

Their trials were not over. As the caravan continued, they faced a full-scale goblin ambush—including riders mounted on spiders and bizarre creatures called "Squigs." Amidst the chaos, the party coordinated skill checks, spells, and martial prowess from moving carts. Multiple party members (particularly Aurelia) were knocked unconscious during the harrowing fight, but ultimately, the enemies were vanquished or left behind, and the caravan survived the ambush.

After additional days on the road, the party finally arrived at Teghrim's Crossing, a formidable bridge settlement spanning a wide river, marking the gateway to new adventures.

## Combat & Challenges

- **Auroch Attack:** During travel, the party defended their wagon from massive, wild aurochs. Various tactics were used, including martial strikes by Bruldin, attempts at magical and musical influence, and survival skills. The aurochs were ultimately driven away, though not without damage to the cart.
- **Snotling Intrusion:** Aurelia encountered and swiftly defeated a group of young goblins while alone at a rest stop, discretely disposing of the threat and their remains.

- **Goblin Ambush (Spider & Squig Riders):** As the caravan traversed the plains, a major goblin ambush occurred featuring unusual mounts and hit-and-run tactics. The fight was chaotic and hard-fought, with several party members knocked unconscious before victory was achieved through dogged teamwork and timely NPC aid.
