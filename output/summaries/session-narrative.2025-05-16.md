# The Long Road East

The first breath of autumn clung to the wind as the trading boat creaked free from Ni’s harbor, sliding into the mist that clung like memory to the icy Solstheim coast. Arnór Josefson, his gaze steady and distant, lingered at the rail—watching the homeland fade while fate's knotted threads tugged him eastward toward promise and peril. Dice clacked in his palm as he drifted among sailors and passengers, his easy conversation and wry games of chance breaking the chill—a Norn of lonely luck, but never without stories.

Among the travelers: Aurelia, pale and poised, her noble bearing shadowed by secrets. The Dhampir watched the world with measured calm, warmth flickering behind her eyes only in rare moments, as during their gamble over a battered dice cup. Her presence drew respectful distance—or, when the moon rose and the restless dead pressed in, uneasy awe.

Several days passed upon the thrall-grey waves until Menoth-Derith’s towers and walls rose before them—a new port city carved from ambition and stone, its wild borderland bustle a living testament to Duergar pragmatism and Norn steel. Here, Bruldin Grimstone waited—a mountain of a Duergar, shrouded in the legend of his warhammer, "Old Bessie." The air thrummed with the tension of old clan rivalries—now twisted into hard-won alliances, not far from breaking.

As ships docked and the market thronged, Bruldin and his “Wild West” hospitality greeted the newcomers. Caravan banners fluttered, and soldiers gathered—eastbound for Teghrim’s Crossing. Among the arrivals from a distant caravan out of the Jade Kingdoms, Qotal—scaly, serene, marked by glowing tattoos—walked with Lynn Chong, elder priest and quiet caretaker of faith. They discussed gods and fate along muddy lanes, weaving myth with memory, as the scent of tea and incense offered small comforts at world’s edge.

By day's turn, Peatan, the weathered caravan leader, gathered them all. In a battered walled yard, he spoke straight and offered what he could: gold, travel, and danger. The task was simple—until darkness called. Bruldin and Arnór, Aurelia, Qotal, and Lynn took up their new pact as rearguard protectors. The first miles east were strained with rumors of orc and goblin raids and the half-heard wailing of totems upon the wind.

Through jungle and plain, the caravan pressed on, each day a negotiation between vigilance and attrition. It was in the lonely mountain serai—with its crumbling walls and grotesque goblin fetishes—that Aurelia found herself alone. The silence was thick, broken only by her breath and the clatter of stones against hastily arrayed traps. She was at ease in such emptiness, and yet, when snotlings slipped from the dark—feral, desperate, baring tiny teeth—her response was swift. The dance was over before the snotlings could grasp its stakes; their blood was a resource she could not let pass, and the shadows kept her secret as she cleaned her blade.

Meanwhile, the main caravan rumbled nearer, tense and rumor-laden. The party arrived, fortifying the serai with labor and cunning: Bruldin raised sturdy stakes and spun bold tales of troll-slaying; Arnór painted sigils on goblin totems until their eerie aura snapped even the bravest to alertness. Qotal, with measured patience, set tripwire snares that could turn monsters back or give warning of doom. Aurelia’s traps were less successful—reminders that not every knife finds its mark; but her silence remained her cover.

That night, laughter by the fire gave way to shouts in goblinish, the frantic rustle of feet beyond the stakes. Bruldin’s warning javelin sent a message, but it was Droroc—a towering orc—who spat demands at the barricade. Qotal met him, eyes like polished obsidian, and refused surrender. The orc’s surprise at the Slaan’s defiance curdled to fury.

Steel rang out. The enemy surged over the barriers: goblins swarming, Droroc roaring. Bruldin’s warhammer smashed an auroch aside, then traded blood with the orc. Arnór’s mystical words bent fate, needles of force flickering in the night; Aurelia darted through the melee, her rapier thirsty for foes. Qotal’s acrobatics and staff blurred as he moved to intercept flanking goblins. Amid the chaos, wounds were taken—Bruldin and Qotal both fell beneath the orc’s relentless blows.

But fortune circled back. Knutfig, Arnór’s spirit-familiar, twisted luck upon Droroc, sapping his certainty. Arnór’s magic and Aurelia’s blade struck as one—Droroc died beneath their teamwork, his band broken and the camp saved, though at grave cost.

As cold dawn crested, Lynn’s careful hands and healer’s kit brought their friends back to pain and breath. Blood was washed from the stones; the caravan moved on.

The days across the Primeval Forest were uneasy, shadows stretching ever longer as the battered group wound east beneath brooding mammoths and the thunder of distant beasts. Each night, the party drew closer: Qotal shared half-remembered songs, Lin Chong poured calming tea, and Bruldin (gruff and scarred, but living) recounted glories past. Around the fire, secrets trickled out—Arnór’s wanderlust, Bruldin’s yearning for a worthy end, Aurelia’s vague hints at a promised debt, Qotal’s need for a moss-eaten carving. Lin, dwelling in quiet devotion, discussed the dream of restoring an ancient healing shrine.

Soon, the forest thinned, and hope crept back—until goblin war cries shattered the hush near Teghrim’s Crossing. Arrowstorms fell upon the party, goblins in mad number battering the wagons. Arnór’s magic danced, Qotal’s voice boomed threats that set lesser foes running, and Aurelia’s crossbow sang her deadly reply. The ground shook—squigs and spider riders bounded into battle. Steel flashed; Aurelia fell, only to be revived by Lynn’s deft healing. The fight turned on a blade’s edge: Bruldin landed a crushing blow, Arnór’s spells cracked through monstrous ranks, and together the party stood as one until no foe remained upright.

Scattered, aching, but alive, the survivors crossed the final bridge. Teghrim’s Crossing—city of bridges, shadows, and unwritten futures—opened before them. Here, the caravan’s service ended, and Peatan paid gold in battered coin and weary gratitude.

As darkness fell, a new sort of challenge began: the “Dramatis Personae” system—an invitation into the tangled webs of relationships, mentorship, and destiny that wound tighter than either road or blade. Around the fire, as coins changed hands and wounds were bound, something like hope stirred—a sense that amidst the risk and uncertainty of the wild frontier, the bonds they were forging might someday matter more than steel or spell.
