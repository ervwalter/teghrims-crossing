# Shadows Over Teghrim’s Crossing

The first light of dawn slipped across the spires and unfinished gantries of Menoth-Derith’s cliffside docks, where the grinding of stone echoed above the patient murmurs of the Norn sailors. Arnór Josefson—tall, fair of hair, and ever watchful—stood at the prow, dice already resting in his palm. With the sour tang of salt and grain thick on the air, he flashed his most disarming smile at Aurelia: elegant and aloof, pale hands gloved above the silver of her rapiers. The Norn men, lulled by the familiar shanties of travel, joined Arnór in games of chance. Laughter rose and fell with the waves, breaking through old anxieties as the great grey cliffs fell behind.

On another road—a shadowed caravan track beneath the rain-wet trees of the Jade Kingdoms—Qotal, scales muted in the dim mist, sipped steaming tea from Lynn Chong’s battered cup. Lynn’s staff gleamed with gold and prayer ribbons. “Rare, to meet a Slaan here,” he said, smiling beneath his beard. Qotal’s tail flicked as he spoke of Zapotlatena, the living earth. Lynn’s eyes shone with reverence, folding Qotal’s strange faith into the sprawling ancestor tales of these lands. The fire snapped beside them, blending incense with the green breath of the forest.

The world grew rougher as stone gave way to splintered lumber and busy hammers—Menoth-Derith, the Grey-rock city, its streets torn between Norn ambition and Duergar suspicion. Bruldin Grimstone waited with folded arms by a half-built wall, broad as any ox and twice as vigilant, his warhammer “Old Bessie” resting against the stones. Old feuds hung in the air, yet among the harbor’s newcomers, eyes widened in respect for this Duergar Slayer.

One morning, the first ship from Ni slid into port, and out stepped Arnór and Aurelia, their purposes private but their next destination shared: eastward, where gold, glory, or secrets awaited. Their meeting with the recently arrived caravan was brisk, Peatan—weathered yet cordial—laying terms without artifice. All would join the rearguard in exchange for coin and safe passage to Teghrim’s Crossing. Bruldin, known as a living legend, drew deferential bows from the other dwarves. Among the swirling conversations, the diverse travelers—Qotal with his lute, Lyn the gentle priest, and the noblewoman Aurelia—fell into easy, if wary, camaraderie.

At sunrise, the mountain air thinned as they wedged themselves into moving columns, carts creaking beneath sacks of grain and slabs of smoked meat. Aurelia soon slipped away eastward with a group of her kind: dhampirs escorting her through twisting tunnels toward a lonely serai, ringed by goblin-scaring totems. Here, alone, she listened to the breathing dark, tension behind the walls—a patient observer in the silence.

The caravan crawled through the wild—great pine knots clutching at the road, the sky crowding close and green. Near Tigran’s Crossing, the land opened: misted in the breath of mammoth and giant, with only a trembling line of wagons between civilization and ruin. They had little warning before the ground thundered with the charge of aurochs—vast, woolly behemoths that battered carts like tempests. 

Bruldin’s battle-roar cut through the chaos, his maul meeting the thick skull of a beast, making it falter but not flee. Arnór poised for a cunning word, only to earn the herd’s ire—and grim amusement from his companions. Qotal’s music offered peace, but the aurochs cared little for the orchard queen’s memory; nature rolled on, indifferent.

The battered carts groaned as the herd passed, and the group inspected splintered axles under starlight—a small preview of what the frontier would demand.

Far within the serai, Aurelia’s solitude broke when snotlings—goblin young, savage and hungry—crept in, daggers glinting in the gloom. She moved with calculated elegance, her senses sharp with old predatory instinct; their threat ended as quickly as it began, her crossbow and silent blade ensuring no alarm was raised. Afterward, she mused on hunger, cleaning dagger and conscience with equal care.

Dawn brought armored riders: mercenary vanguard, all scowls and suspicion. Aurelia faced them with poised, cool answers, risking neither lie nor confession. The camp’s leader—hard, mercantile—offered employment as rearguard. When the full caravan rejoined, the travelers became a true company, each bringing scars, hopes, and half-told stories to the long journey east.

That night, they gathered to secure the camp beneath the watchful eyes of goblin totems; Bruldin drove stakes with tales of wrestling trolls, Aurelia wove spellcraft into the totems’ faces, and Qotal set snares so cunning as to earn discreet admiration. Arnór set what traps he could from scant supplies, laughter dancing as much at their jerry-rigging as their successes.

But the night remained restless. Goblin voices whispered in the dark, curses rising on the wind. Bruldin’s shout and thrown javelin broke the tension, drawing forth an orc boss with ugly demands. The group parried words with threats: Bruldin brandished Old Bessie; Qotal’s tattoos glowed with otherworldly menace; Aurelia’s eyes flickered with secrets. When negotiation collapsed, violence erupted—goblin and snotling blades flashing, Bruldin’s hammer splattering foes, Arnór weaving frosty darts, Qotal’s staff and song a dance of death. Aurelia, poised and unrelenting, put down foes that slipped past the line.

The orc Doorkwill thundered in, scattering the defense. Bruldin fell, then Qotal, the battle hanging by a thread. Arnór’s call to old spirit Knutfig weakened their enemy, and, with precise savagery, Aurelia’s blade found its mark—ending the orc’s threat with a thrust between the eyes. The survivors patched their wounds with rough kindness, wary of all that still prowled outside the firelight.

The days stretched into green gloom as the caravan rolled beneath forest canopies, giant shadows flickering at the edge of sight. Only at the outpost by the river—safely inside stone walls—did the company breathe freely again. That night, campfire tales were spun: Qotal played melodies gentle as a summer rain, answered by Lin’s delicate cup of tea; Arnór’s flute trilled beneath Bruldin’s low laughter. Sylvia Mournhold, healer and fixer, praised their ferocity and skill. Old tales surfaced—a slayer’s beard noosed about a troll’s neck, a monk’s quest for ancient carvings, the dhampir’s haunted errand for a friend. Even Aurelia confessed a mission for someone lost. The group found comfort in their differences: Norn runes, Slaan spirit marks, Grail blood, Ducal pride, and secrets from the Jade Kingdom.

East of the river, the land opened into peril. Goblin raiders sprang from the grass, slinging stones, shrieking in their tongue. The company pressed on, attacks weathered by clever spells and intimidation; Bruldin and Qotal shielded the drivers, Aurelia’s crossbow barked defiance, Arnór’s eyes blazed with occult menace. The wild grew wilder—spider-riders charged, squigs bounded, and chaos erupted as the wagons sped side-by-side, carving their escape through heaps of foes. Blood spilled on wood and earth. Brave Lin hauled Aurelia back from the brink over and over, as Bruldin smashed through monsters, the company battered, but unbowed.

The lights of Tigran’s Cross gleamed at last atop the stone span of Teghrim’s Crossing—refuge and promise both. Among the battered wagons, wounds were dressed, coin pressed into calloused palms, and the promise of new labors flickered in every passing torch.

For now, the shadows drew back from the bridge—a moment’s peace before the next call for heroes in a world that would always need them.
