HOST: Welcome back, everyone, to another installment of Caravan Chronicles! I’m your host, and joining me today is a special guest who’s been following every twist and turn along the winding roads of Septerra. Welcome to the show!

GUEST: Thanks for having me! I’m still catching my breath after last session’s gauntlet of monsters, mayhem, and mysterious blood-drinking, but happy to be here.

HOST: Let’s set the scene—our story kicked off on September 16th, 2025, with Arnór Josefson boarding a trading boat in Ni, leaving Solstheim behind. We’ve got dice games on deck, Norn sailors at the oars, and a noblewoman named Aurelia keeping an eye on things. Not a bad way to start a campaign, right?

GUEST: Absolutely. The sail to Menoth-Derith was a nice moment of calm before the storm. But you could already sense that everyone, from Arnór to the mysterious Aurelia, was sizing up the other passengers—not just for fun, but for who might hold their own if trouble started brewing.

HOST: And trouble did, of course, start brewing. Meanwhile, while the boat’s bobbing toward Menoth-Derith, we cut to the Jade Kingdoms, where Qotal, the lizardfolk monk with those glowing tattoos, is chatting with Lynn Chong about religion and destiny. I love that they went right from metaphysics to caravan management by the time they hit Menoth-Derith!

GUEST: It’s classic—deep philosophy one moment, then “please guard these crates” the next. Once everyone gathers in Menoth-Derith, we meet Bruldin Grimstone: Duergar slayer, campfire entertainer, and aspiring legend. The party signs on as caravan rearguard, and Peatan, the caravan leader, basically says, "If you survive, there’s gold in it for you."

HOST: Who could resist that pitch? The journey east, though, went south in a hurry. Let’s talk about the aurochs stampede—suddenly, we’ve got massive wild cattle barreling down on the party’s carts. Bruldin smashes one, Arnór tries intimidation with a little astrological flair and, uh… critically agitates the herd. Were you expecting such a slapstick failure?

GUEST: I laughed out loud. Half the party’s joking about his “scary star charts” while Qotal starts waxing poetic about aurochs nature. Meanwhile, Aurelia tries soothing music with "Ashes of the Orchard Queen"—great song, only calms her own nerves. The party barely fends off the beasts and has to fix their carts before moving on.

HOST: Speaking of tense moments, Aurelia gets her spotlight in the caravanserai—surrounded by goblin totems, sneaking snotlings, and some tough moral choices. She ends up dispatching three goblin children and quickly disposing of the evidence. Later, when questioned by mercenaries and the party, she smooths it over, but you just know that secret’s going to come back, don’t you think?

GUEST: Oh, absolutely! It’s a ticking time bomb for drama. But there was hardly time to dwell—immediately, they’re setting camp defenses. Bruldin is hammering in fortifications, Arnór’s basically mass-producing freaky totems with some occult flair, Qotal’s setting perfect tripwires, and Aurelia… well, she tried her hand at traps with mixed results.

HOST: Teamwork at its finest—or at least, most chaotic. Night brings a goblin and orc delegation, led by Droroc, demanding a toll and searching for missing kids. Qotal stands tall and declares the road free, Bruldin tosses a javelin in classic intimidation style, and negotiations quickly dissolve into a wild melee.

GUEST: It was a slugfest. Bruldin and Qotal both get knocked out—big drama!—while Arnór and Aurelia, with a little help from Knutfig, turn the tide. That rapier strike from Aurelia finishing Droroc was deliciously cinematic. The whole party gets banged up but survives, and as they limp onward, there’s a moment around the campfire where everyone shares their actual quest reasons—Arnór’s chasing adventure, Bruldin’s after a heroic end, Aurelia’s got secrets to uncover, and Qotal’s searching for that moss-eaten carving.

HOST: That blend of recovery and reflection really pulled the group together… but their reprieve is short-lived. Approaching Teghrim’s Crossing, goblins launch a fresh ambush—slings start flying, drivers are panicking, and then, out of nowhere, squigs and spider riders crash the party.

GUEST: Wild! Aurelia goes down, but Lynn Chong’s healing keeps her in the fight—barely. Bruldin lands some critical blows on the squigs, Arnór is slinging spells, and Qotal’s intimidating goblins left and right. Even “Stripes”—the memorable goblin—gets floored. It’s frantic but fun, showing off everyone’s strengths… and hilarious weaknesses.

HOST: Finally, battered but paid, the caravan makes it to Teghrim’s Crossing. The GM unveils a new Dramatis Personae mentor system, and it feels like a new chapter’s just beginning. Gold for everyone—plus the promise of more quests and maybe, just maybe, new friendships.

GUEST: I can’t wait to see the repercussions of all those messy secrets and alliances. From wild battles to mystery and character drama, this session had it all—plus, let’s be real, maybe the world’s first punk rock goblin totem.

HOST: That’s all for today’s episode of Caravan Chronicles. Whether you’re here for the action, the intrigue, or just the dice-fueled disasters, stick with us—we’ll be back soon with more stories from Septerra’s road. Thanks for joining me!

GUEST: Always a pleasure. See you down the trail!
