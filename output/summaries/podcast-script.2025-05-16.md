HOST: Welcome back to the Caravan Chronicles podcast, where we retell the wildest adventures on the road through Septerra! I’m your host, and joining me today is our resident expert on all things dicey and dramatic—thanks for being here.

GUEST: Always a pleasure! And with this latest session, wild is definitely the word. Giants, goblins, and more than one close call… Shall we dive in?

HOST: Absolutely. Let’s set the stage. Our story picks up on the Norn ship out of Ni, with Arnór Josefson—a witch with a knack for dice and destiny—heading east with a hold full of grain. Who else is on board for this trade run?

GUEST: That would be Aurelia, the mysterious Dhampir rogue, blending that noble air with a touch of “don’t mess with me.” She’s got some seriously fine rapiers, and let’s just say, when the dice roll out, so does her reputation.

HOST: Now while Arnór’s charming the sailors, the action splits west—Qotal, our Slaan monk, is making his way across the Jade Kingdoms with Lynn Chong. We get tea, spiritual talk, and even a rundown on his mission… Something to do with a mossy old carving?

GUEST: Exactly! Qotal’s quest is all about finding this ancient, moss-eaten dwarf statue somewhere down the line—very zen, but, you know… with more goblin ambushes and less peace and quiet. And Lynn? He wields a holy staff and knows how to brew a mean pot of tea—key skills for any long road trip.

HOST: The groups all converge at Menoth-Derith—the city bustling with trade, construction, and that old Duergar-Norn rivalry simmering in the background. Tell us about Bruldin Grimstone’s first appearance there.

GUEST: Bruldin’s a legend among dwarves. As a Duergar barbarian and self-styled Slayer, he’s itching for a glorious scrap—and makes quite an entrance with his signature warhammer, Old Bessie. By the time our caravan’s ready to roll out for Teghrim’s Crossing, he’s got everyone on their toes… and a touch nervous.

HOST: Speaking of nerves, things do NOT go smoothly. The caravan’s barely on the move before they’re bombarded by a herd of angry aurochs. Did the team handle that with grace?

GUEST: Let’s call it “creative effort.” Bruldin swings Old Bessie but only buys them a moment. Qotal tries calming music—wrong audience. Arnór tries Norn astrology to scare the beasts… accidentally insults them instead. The party jokes about nature’s indifference, and honestly, it’s a miracle they only lose a cart wheel!

HOST: Meanwhile, Aurelia’s off the beaten path—camping at a mountain serai, prepping traps when three feral snotlings sneak in. How does that play out?

GUEST: She keeps her cool, sizes them up, then dispatches all three before they even blink. She’s got the moves and the nerve, and just quietly cleans up the scene. Soon after, the caravan’s mercenary vanguard stumbles upon her, and she has to charm her way onto their good side—no easy feat with that crowd.

HOST: Back at camp, everyone’s working overtime. Bruldin is fortifying entrances and regaling the crew with tales about strangling trolls with his beard. Qotal’s tripwires are legendary, and Aurelia? She cranks up the creepy factor on the goblin totems. But then… the real trouble starts with Doorkwill, the orc boss.

GUEST: Oh, Doorkwill. He demands a toll, and the standoff gets tense. Bruldin brandishes his hammer, Qotal flashes the glowing tattoos, but diplomacy goes nowhere. When the orc busts in, all hell breaks loose—snotlings swarm, the orc goes for the heavy hitters, and the party’s fighting for their lives. We get some near-knockouts, desperate spells, and finally, Aurelia lands the finishing blow—right between Doorkwill’s eyes.

HOST: They barely get time to breathe before another high-speed duel—this time, goblin cavalry with spider riders and “squigs” attack as the caravan races for Tigran’s Crossing. Any standouts in that chaos?

GUEST: Bruldin’s critical hits turn squigs into pudding, Arnór unleashes spellwork that rattles foes, and Aurelia just won’t stay down—even after being knocked out, she’s patched up and firing crossbow bolts from the cart. Qotal’s intimidation game turns the tide, getting those goblins to think twice.

HOST: It’s not all fighting—once they reach safety, there’s music, tales by the fire, and our crew revealing what drives them. Qotal shares his quest for that mossy carving, Aurelia hints at a mysterious investigation, and Bruldin, as always, just wants a worthy battle.

GUEST: That closing campfire moment really brought out their personalities. Stories, music, a fresh pot of tea… and the faint sense that, despite all odds, they might just be starting to trust each other.

HOST: And that’s our episode recap! From shattered wheels to shattered goblins, our travelers are battered but gold-rich, ready for whatever the bridge-town of Teghrim’s Crossing throws at them next. Any final thoughts?

GUEST: If this is just the start, I can’t wait to see what legendary mess they stumble into next. And maybe, just maybe, they’ll have learned not to insult any more aurochs.

HOST: Thanks for tuning in! We’ll be back with more caravan craziness next week. Until then—keep your rapiers sharp and your bridge tolls paid!
