# Fey Trials and the Willow’s Rescue

## Session Overview
The party transitioned from caravan guards to freelancers upon arrival at **Teghrim’s Crossing**, quickly entangling themselves in town politics and the troubled forests to the west. Through tense negotiations, magical tests by fey, and hard-fought battles in faerie-haunted glades, the group forged new alliances and rescued the local Willow Dryad, securing magical rewards and furthering their reputation as resourceful adventurers.

## Story Developments
As dusk settled over the bridge-town of **Teghrim’s Crossing**, the caravan—including the party—was greeted by local guards and directed to well-earned food and lodging. Discussion with the guards revealed growing strains in settlement order, much of it attributed to unruly mercenaries and an undercurrent of wild goblin activity threatening both commerce and security.

The next morning, the party met with **Irka Spritzel**, the pragmatic dwarven captain, in his administrative tower. Irka outlined the town’s history—founded just forty years prior and recently expanded—and its current vulnerabilities: monstrous incursions, wild goblins, and infrastructure demands exacerbated by ongoing “growing pains.” Notably, Irka explained the controversial but effective use of domesticated goblins—“noblins”—for repair work, drawing skepticism and curiosity from the party.

When offered a choice of assignments, the party divided: some remained to assist with caravan logistics and goblin laborers, while **Qotal** and **Arnór Josefson** joined a local guard in a patrol of the Primeval Forest west of town, where fey unrest was reported. In the woods, the pair met a trio of fairies—**Silvermist**, **Fawn**, and **Iridescent**—who proposed an alliance, but only if the adventurers passed whimsical yet telling moral tests. After proving their good intentions, the fey guided them into a glade surrounded by crumbling statues—soon revealed, through learned scrutiny, to be petrified people.

The party aided the fey in reviving a petrified human chef, **Alrik Grimmelstang**, alongside his sprite companion, **Vidia** (now a noncombatant party asset and magical “bag of holding”). Through pantomime, Vidia revealed that the culprit was not the fey but a lurking basilisk, still at large. Accepting the call to service, the group agreed to help the fey and the Great Willow Dryad deeper in the forest.

On their journey through the haunted woods, the party fended off a charging pair of wild boars and a deadly squad of venomous, thorn-covered vine creatures. Rejoining the rest of their companions and guided by returning fey, they accepted healing berries and magical aid. Further allied by a wood elf, **Aelysh**, who provided enchanted acorns for safe passage, and joined by older Norn warriors **Grimnar** and **Ulric**, the strengthened party pressed on.

In the web-laden glade, a desperate battle unfolded: the group fought webs, toxic spiders (including the formidable **Skull Spider** and “Red One”), and immobilizing plant monsters to rescue the captive **Willow Dryad**. Thanks to tactical teamwork—torch-wielding, healing, and flank attacks—they freed the Dryad, drove off or killed the spiders, and secured a formidable magical mace and other treasures as gratitude.

With new allies (Alrik, Vidia), magical items, and the thanks of both fey and local leadership, the party prepared to report on their deeds, introducing Lynn and Sylvia to the settlement and laying the groundwork for new quests and deeper integration into the region’s evolving drama.

## Notable Character Moments
- **Qotal** volunteered for the fey patrol, deftly navigating the fairies’ moral riddles and taking a leading role in negotiation and frontline battles.
- **Arnór Josefson** accompanied Qotal, contributed to solving the mystery of the petrifications, and wielded potent magics (Needle Darts) in the wilds.
- **Bruldin Grimstone** pledged the party’s support in the name of Grimnir, took decisive action in combat (notably against boars and vine creatures), and responded to the fey’s unfamiliar customs with both skepticism and eventual respect.
- **Aurelia** continued to improvise in battle—using a pole weapon, quick movement, and deadly strikes, while quietly managing her vampiric needs after conflict.
- **Alrik Grimmelstang**, once petrified, brought levity, confusion, and the promise of secret recipes to the group after his revival.
- **Vidia**, now the party’s magical light and inventory, emerged as both a narrative and practical asset.
- **Broden Tide**, **Kent**, **Aric**, and **Hal** joined in the forest battles, providing crucial healing, melee prowess, and support despite some ambiguity over their longer-term status.

## Combat & Challenges
Two primary encounters tested the party’s mettle:
- In the **petrified glade**, wild boars and vine monstrosities ambushed the adventurers; tactical spellcasting, coordinated flanking, and powerful melee blows repelled the attackers, but not before wounds and status effects demanded magical healing from fey allies.
- In the **webbed glade**, the fight escalated with the appearance of the Skull Spider, multiple web-throwing spiders, and more vine monsters. Party members were webbed, poisoned, and at risk of KO, but teamwork (including torchwork to clear webs and magical healing) turned the tide. The last spiders fled after their leaders were slain, and the party tended wounds and divided magical loot provided by the grateful Willow Dryad.

## Discoveries & Lore
- **Teghrim’s Crossing** was explored in detail, highlighting its mix of Norn, Dwarf, and cosmopolitan influences, its pragmatic adoption of noblins, and its dual social structure (upper wealthy tier and worker/hostel quarters).
- **Primeval Forest** west of the settlement is a whimsical and dangerous fey-haunted zone; revealed to house petrification victims, magical glades, and complex fairy politics.
- **Basilisk** confirmed as cause of the forest petrifications, presenting an enduring threat and potential quest objective.
- New magical customs and fey bargains experienced: enchanted healing berries, safe-passage acorns, powerful oils, and the whimsical protocols of fairy society.
- Emerging status for the party as trusted freelancers bridging the gap between town authority and mystical forest denizens.
