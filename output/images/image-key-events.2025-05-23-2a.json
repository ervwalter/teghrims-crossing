  "title": "Assault in the Webbed Glade",
  "prompt": "Epic fantasy battle scene in a tangled, web-strewn forest clearing, spiders and vine-creatures surging toward a desperate adventuring band. In the foreground, Bruldin Grimstone (male Duergar, gray-skinned, thick-bearded, muscular, swinging a massive warhammer) and Aurelia (female Dhampir, pale, elegant, dark-haired, in light armor with crossbow and rapier) face off against a grotesque Skull Spider (giant, spiny, venom-dripping) as Kotal (emerald-scaled Slaan monk) struggles, half-cocooned in sticky webs. Magical bursts cast by Arn√≥r (Norn, robed, channeling astrological arts) illuminate the chaos. The bound Willow Dryad (willow-haired, arboreal, and luminous) recoils in the background as allies and fey weave through the fray. Cinematic, dynamic composition, dramatic lighting; inspiration from ArtStation fantasy battle art.",
