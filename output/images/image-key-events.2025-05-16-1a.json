  "title": "Night Raid at the Caravanserai",
  "prompt": "Semi-realistic fantasy art, a tense nocturnal scene at a fortified mountain caravanserai. Aurelia (Dhampir woman, pale skin, noble features, dark hair, wearing light armor and wielding a bloodied rapier) stands alone in the moonlit interior, tense and resolute, facing three snarling snotlings (feral, juvenile goblins, wiry and wild-eyed). Broken goblin totems glint in the torchlight outside, and shadows flicker on the heavy wooden gates. Cold blue and orange lighting creates a chilling, suspenseful mood; painterly detail with gothic undertones.",
