  "title": "The Stand Against Droroc",
  "prompt": "Epic fantasy concept art, the party’s desperate stand behind defensive stakes and makeshift barricades at the edge of the jungle. Bruldin Grimstone (male Duergar, gray skin, thick beard, muscular build, gripping a massive warhammer) and Qotal (male Slaan/Lizardfolk, emerald scales, glowing tattoos, poised with a bo staff) clash against Droroc (massive orc warlord, broad-shouldered, tusked, heavy armor, wielding a brutal greataxe) and a mob of goblins under torchlight. The atmosphere is electric with flying javelins, magical flashes from Arnór Josefson (Norn man, pale blond, robed, casting with astrology symbols swirling) and Aurelia (fierce, blood-spattered), as chaos erupts. Cinematic wide shot, dramatic contrast, high detail, stormy skies overhead.",
