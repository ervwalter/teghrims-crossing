  "prompt": "High-detail digital painting showing a moving caravan under assault on the Nedavalier Trade Route. Carts careen along a forested path as goblin spider-riders and hulking squigs leap from the undergrowth. Qotal (Slaan monk, staff raised, fiercely parrying), Bruldin (Duergar barbarian, swinging his warhammer mid-battle), Arn√≥r (Norn witch, pointing as magical darts streak toward enemies), and Aurelia (Dhampir with crossbow, bloodied but unbroken, fighting to rise after a fall) are amid desperate melee and magical chaos. Motion blur, slashing rain, vivid greens and glistening reds, ArtStation realism with urgent, heroic energy.",
