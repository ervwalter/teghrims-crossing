  "title": "The Petrified Glade Awakens",
  "prompt": "High-detail fantasy concept art depicting the party in an eerie, twilight glade encircled by ancient, crumbling statues—each the petrified remains of past adventurers—while Qotal (Slaan/Lizardfolk male monk, emerald scales, glowing tattoos) and Arnór Josefson (Norn male witch, pale blond, robed) stand over a stone figure being revived by faerie magic. The fey Silvermist (small, ethereal blue fairy) and Iridescent (shy pink fairy) hover, their magical lights casting dappled glows as a human chef (Alrik Grimmelstang, disheveled, bewildered) and a tiny sprite (Vidia, winged, radiant) stir back to life. Somber, mystical lighting with shadows dancing over mossy stones; style: semi-realistic digital painting, atmospheric and otherworldly.",
