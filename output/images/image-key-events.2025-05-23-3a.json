  "title": "The Willow Dryad’s Blessing",
  "prompt": "Painterly, emotionally charged scene in a tranquil post-battle glade beneath a great ancient willow—its branches arching over the battered but victorious party as the Willow Dryad (ethereal feminine spirit, bark-skin, draping willow hair, glowing eyes) extends her hands in gratitude, healing light emanating toward her rescuers. Foremost stand Qotal (Slaan monk, emerald scales), Bruldin Grimstone (male Duergar, imposing, armored with warhammer resting on shoulder), Aurelia (Dhampir, elegant, blood-spattered but upright), and Arnór Josefson (Norn witch, calm, observant), each expressing relief and awe. Magical club and gemstones glint amidst roots at their feet, with small fey—Vidia, Silvermist—watching from the air. Warm, golden-green light filters through the canopy, style: detailed, hopeful, classic fantasy epilogue.",
