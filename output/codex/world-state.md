# World State

## Political Landscape
- **Menoth-Derith**: Recently established trade city (Duergar, Norn influences); high tensions between historic trading clans, rapid settlement and construction, “Wild West” environment.
- **Caravan Route East**: Policed by mercenaries and the caravan’s own defenders, passing through contested and perilous territory (orc, goblin lands).

## Active Conflicts
- **Caravan vs. Goblin/Orc Warbands**: Ongoing skirmishes as the caravan traverses dangerous regions; repeated ambushes, toll demands, and battles for control of the road.

## Seasonal & Time-Dependent Events
- **Active Construction**: Menoth-Derith is in a constant state of building and settlement.

## Economic Conditions
- **Booming but Volatile Trade**: Trade between Norn, Duergar, and eastward settlements is lucrative but risky; gold paid to caravan guards, grain traded.

## Social/Cultural Notes
- **Multi-ethnic Caravans**: Party reflects the growing pluralism (Norn, Duergar, Slaan, Dhampir, Jade Kingdoms, etc.) that is emerging around the new eastern trade routes. Cultural exchange and tensions noted at every stage.
