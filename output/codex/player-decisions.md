# Player Decisions & Consequences

## Major Decisions
- **Party Accepts Caravan Guard Role** – Session 2025-05-16; all PCs agree to protect the eastbound caravan in return for passage and gold (Peatan’s offer). Immediate consequence: PCs placed on rearguard duty, encounter multiple threats.
- **Aurelia Kills Snotlings at Serai** – Uses Society and Nature skills to identify, then dispatches them when threatened. Party later denies knowledge to orc leader Doorkwill during toll confrontation.
- **Refusal to Pay Orc Toll/Diplomatic Standoff** – Bruldin, Qotal, and others refuse Doorkwill’s demands and threats at the fort, resulting in combat. PC actions during conflict influence goblin/orc morale, trigger fierce response.
- **Individual Roles During Camp Defense** – PCs select tasks: fortify (Bruldin), traps (Arnór, Qotal), magic (Aurelia), supporting each other and influencing camp safety/success.

## Long-term Consequences
- **Defeat of Doorkwill & Goblin Foes** – Session 2025-05-16. Orc and goblin group decimated during fort defense; party reputation in caravan rises, potential new enemies made among goblin factions.

## Altered Relationships
- **Party/Caravan** – Initial wariness transforms into camaraderie after shared trials and combat; party recognized for defense efforts.
- **Aurelia & Patrol/Mercenaries** – Surly but respectful after careful diplomacy; Dhampir status prompts suspicion but is resolved.

## World State Changes
- **Caravan Progresses East** – After successful defense and battles, caravan continues through dangerous regions toward Teghrim’s Crossing. Party receives payment and new responsibilities.
