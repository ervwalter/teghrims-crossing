## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The GM describes feral goblins in Astoria: they are vicious but low on the food chain, hiding from most threats, especially undead.
2. RP – Aurelia (first appearance) decides to stay hidden but prepares to attack if threatened.
3. SCENE – The goblins eventually discover Aurelia, yelping and drawing crude daggers as they approach.
4. RP – Aurelia chooses to attack first.
5. ROLL – **Attack:** Aurelia rolls to attack the goblins → 19 (well above needed) – She easily dispatches all three before they can harm her.
6. RP – Aurelia loots the goblins and, if low on blood tokens, drinks their blood, which is considered low quality but sufficient for her needs. She then disposes of the bodies to avoid leaving evidence in camp.
7. SCENE – The next day, Aurelia hears the sounds of a caravan approaching, including the opening of the gate and horses.
8. RP – Aurelia observes the newcomers, deducing they are likely a caravan but possibly patrols, as humans and dwarves sometimes police the roads in this region.
9. SCENE – The newcomers, a surly group of mercenaries in Renaissance-style armor, enter the encampment, searching for threats and eventually noticing Aurelia.
10. RP – Aurelia explains she is waiting for a caravan, as she was told one would arrive in a few days.
11. SCENE – The mercenaries sheath their swords and approach more calmly.
12. ROLL – **Check:** Aurelia rolls Diplomacy to reassure the mercenaries she is not a threat → 8 total – She is not very convincing, but her presence is not unusual enough to cause alarm.
13. SCENE – The GM explains that Vampyr (and Dhampir) are rare but not kill-on-sight; they are often seen as quasi-nobility or merchants, especially outside Astoria.
14. SCENE – The mercenaries, crude and uncouth, settle in. Aurelia keeps to herself, uncomfortable with their behavior.
15. SCENE – The rest of the party arrives with the main caravan. The caravan leader greets Aurelia and offers her the same deal as the others: help guard the caravan and receive payment upon arrival at Teagarden's Crossing.
16. RP – The party members introduce themselves: Bruldin Grimstone (Duergar), Arnór Josefson (Norn), Qotal (Slaan/Lizardfolk), and Aurelia (Dhampir).
17. SCENE – The caravan prepares to camp for the night. The leader asks the group to help secure the site, offering several skill-based tasks: enhancing goblin totems (Religion), repairing walls/gates (Crafting), setting traps (Survival), or communicating with animals (Nature).
18. ROLL – **Check:** Bruldin Grimstone uses Athletics to drive stakes into the ground, forming defensive barriers → 21 – He successfully fortifies the main entrances, making them dangerous for attackers.
19. RP – Bruldin entertains workers with a story while working.
20. ROLL – **Check:** Qotal uses Religion to enhance and create more goblin totems → 22 – The totems are improved, making the camp appear even more ominous to superstitious orcs and goblins.
21. ROLL – **Check:** Arnór Josefson uses Survival to set traps outside the perimeter and secretly converses with an unseen friend → 8 total – The traps are only partially successful due to unsuitable materials.
22. ROLL – **Check:** Qotal (Erv) sets up well-disguised tripwire snares just inside the defensive spikes using Survival → Critical success – The tripwires are expertly hidden and will effectively trip intruders.
