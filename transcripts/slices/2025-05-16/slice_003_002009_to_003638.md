## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The party travels through mountain tunnels being constructed into a trade route, the Nedavalor trade route, which connects various regions and is significant for the Norn and dwarves.
2. SCENE – The tunnels exit into a fortified caravan serai (first appearance), a rest stop with walls and goblin-scaring totems, where a character is left alone to await a caravan.
3. SCENE – The caravan travels through dangerous, forested terrain, eventually reaching grassy plains near Tigran's Crossing, bordering orc and goblin territory.
4. SCENE – The caravan is attacked by a herd of auroch (giant, wooly bison) that begin headbutting the carts, threatening to overturn them.
5. COMBAT – The party is given two rounds to attempt to scare off or otherwise deal with the auroch using skill checks or attacks.
6. ROLL – **Attack:** Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance) rolls to strike an auroch with his maul (at -1 due to bouncy cart) → 16 (after penalty) vs AC – lands a solid but not devastating blow, causing the auroch to hesitate.
7. RP – Discussion about the caravan's speed and the danger of jumping off; clarification that the auroch are animalistic and aggressive but not intelligent.
8. ROLL – **Check:** Arnór Josefson (first appearance) attempts an Intimidation check (without Intimidating Glare, at penalty for not speaking their language); uses astrology ability, rolls a 1 (penalty), then rolls a 2 for the check, total 1 or 2 – fails, and actually agitates the auroch further.
9. RP – Party jokes that Arnór insulted the auroch's mother; philosophical discussion about nature and the animals' behavior.
10. ROLL – **Check:** Aurelia (first appearance) plays a calming tune on her lute ("Ashes of the Orchard Queen") to soothe the auroch and party; rolls a 7 – not a critical failure, but only calms the party, not the auroch, which continue to attack.
11. COMBAT – The auroch damage the cart's wheels before eventually moving off, having defended their territory.
12. SCENE – Meanwhile, in the caravan serai, three snotlings (very young goblins, also called gits) (first appearance) sneak in and begin snooping around, likely to discover the character hiding there.
13. RP – The character considers options: fighting, avoiding, scaring off, or talking to the snotlings.
