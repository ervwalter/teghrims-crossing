## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The party is in the city of Menoth-Derith, a new, defensible port city built into cliffs, serving as a trading hub with a "Wild West" atmosphere.
2. SCENE – Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance), a Duergar Barbarian, waits in Menoth-Derith, observing the arrival of a Norn ship and a human traveler, both inquiring about heading west.
3. RP – The GM explains the historical enmity and grudging respect between the Norn and Duergar, referencing the Norn Terror/Norn Raids, and their shared reputation as skilled sailors and traders.
4. SCENE – A caravan forms, preparing to head west; Bruldin and the newcomers are joined by a Slann (Qotal, first appearance) and a man from the Jade Kingdoms, both seeking to join the caravan.
5. RP – The caravan leader (NPC, first appearance) welcomes the group, explaining that while Bruldin is not a mercenary, he will receive free passage and possibly gold for serving as rear guard to Tegrims Crossing.
6. RP – The party members confirm their destination is Tegrims Crossing, agreeing to serve as rear guard for the caravan in exchange for potential payment.
7. SCENE – The GM describes the presence and reputation of Dwarven Slayers, noting their scars and the deference shown by other dwarves.
8. SCENE – Aurelia (first appearance), a Dhampir Rogue, is introduced traveling through mountain tunnels along the Nedavalor trade route, escorted by others of her kind to a fortified caravan serai (rest stop).
9. SCENE – Aurelia is left alone at the caravan serai, surrounded by goblin totems and religious iconography meant to ward off goblins and orcs; she chooses to leave the totems undisturbed and waits for the caravan.
10. SCENE – The main caravan, including Bruldin, Qotal, Arnór Josefson (first appearance), and others, departs the next day, traveling through jungle and forest, then grassy plains toward Tegrims Crossing.
11. SCENE – The caravan enters orc and goblin territory east of Tegrims Crossing; after a few days of tense, guarded travel, the caravan is attacked by a herd of aurochs (giant woolly bison) attempting to overturn carts.
12. COMBAT – The party is given two rounds each to attempt skill checks or actions (intimidation, strength, melee, magic, survival, etc.) to scare off or hinder the aurochs threatening the caravan.
