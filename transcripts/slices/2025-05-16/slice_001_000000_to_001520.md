## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The campaign opens on September 16th, 2025, with the GM establishing that the story begins in Subterra, focusing first on a Norse (Norn) man boarding a trading boat in Ni, Solstheim, bound for the Dwarven port of Memphrodirith.
2. SCENE – The Norn trading boat is crewed mostly by Norn sailors transporting grain, with one other obvious passenger: a well-dressed, armored human woman, likely of noble lineage.
3. RP – Arnór Josefson (first appearance) greets fellow passengers and sailors, introducing himself and inviting others to play dice during the voyage.
4. SCENE – The hardened Norn sailors accept Arnór's offer, and the days pass with dice games and travel; the journey to Memphrodirith takes several days.
5. SCENE – Meanwhile, in the Jade Kingdoms region, Qotal (first appearance), a Slaan/Lizardfolk monk, travels with a trade caravan through dangerous lands, accompanied by mercenaries and another passenger: an older gentleman named Lynn (first appearance), who carries a staff and wears religious charms.
6. RP – Qotal is reserved, engaging in conversation only when approached; Lynn is personable, offers tea, and remarks on Qotal's rarity in the region.
7. RP – Qotal introduces himself and references his deity, Zapotlatena, explaining his journey is guided by her breath, tracing a line carved in stone.
8. RP – Lynn is unfamiliar with the name but recognizes Zapotlatena as Gaia, a major deity in the local Taoist/Buddhist-like religion, and the two discuss the syncretism of their beliefs.
9. SCENE – In the city of Menoth-Derith (first appearance), Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance), a Duergar barbarian, waits in the newly built, defensible port city, which has a Wild West atmosphere and is still being settled.
10. SCENE – Bruldin, with a background in seafaring, recognizes the port's strategic location. The city is populated mostly by traders and founding families.
11. SCENE – Troops begin to gather in Menoth-Derith, forming a caravan heading east. A Norn ship arrives, carrying Arnór and the noble human woman (Aurelia, first appearance).
12. RP – There is lingering enmity but mutual respect between the Norn and Duergar, stemming from the historical Norn Raids (the Norn Terror), but both peoples are skilled sailors and traders.
13. SCENE – Bruldin observes the arrival of the Norn and human passengers, who are also seeking to join the eastbound caravan.
14. SCENE – After another day or two, a caravan arrives with Qotal and Lynn, who also wish to join the caravan.
15. SCENE – The party members see each other for the first time as the caravan leader, Peetan (first appearance), welcomes them and offers to let them join the caravan eastward.
