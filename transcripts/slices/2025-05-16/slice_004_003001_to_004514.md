## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The party is surrounded by a herd of aurochs (giant, wooly bison) while traveling; the animals are aggressive and headbutt the cart.
2. RP – The GM explains aurochs are common in Solstheim, tough, aggressive, and often harass caravans for food.
3. RP – A player attempts to intimidate the aurochs by shouting, despite lacking the Intimidating Glare ability and not speaking their language.
4. ROLL – **Check:** Arnór Josefson (first appearance) uses an astrology ability for a bonus to Intimidation → rolls a 1 (penalty), then rolls a 2 on Intimidation (total 2) – Critically fails; the aurochs become more agitated.
5. RP – The GM jokes that Arnór's failed attempt only encourages the aurochs, possibly by flashing red and "insulting their mother."
6. RP – Qotal (first appearance) philosophizes that the aurochs are acting according to their nature, not out of malice.
7. RP – Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance) begins playing a calming tune, "Ashes of the Orchard Queen," on his lute, hoping to soothe the party and the aurochs.
8. ROLL – **Check:** Bruldin Grimstone plays music to calm the aurochs → rolls a 7 – Not a critical failure, but only calms the party, not the animals; the aurochs continue damaging the cart.
9. SCENE – The aurochs eventually leave, but the cart is damaged, especially the wheels, as the party passes through their territory.
10. SCENE – Later, Aurelia (first appearance) is alone at an abandoned caravanserai at night and hears noises; three small creatures (snotlings, very young goblins) sneak in and begin snooping around.
11. RP – The GM explains goblin types: domesticated (quasi-servants, poor climbers) and feral (vicious, bottom of the food chain, common in Astoria but not thriving due to undead).
12. ROLL – **Check:** Aurelia rolls Society (16+6) and Nature (15+2) to identify the goblins and their traits – Success; learns about goblin types and their behaviors.
13. SCENE – The snotlings discover Aurelia, yelp, and threaten her with tiny daggers, preparing to attack.
14. COMBAT – Aurelia chooses to attack first.
15. ROLL – **Attack:** Aurelia rolls to attack the snotlings → 19 total – Easily kills all three before they can reach her.
16. RP – Aurelia loots the bodies and, if low on blood tokens, drinks their blood (considered "low quality wine" for dhampir); she disposes of the bodies discreetly.
17. SCENE – The next day, Aurelia hears horses and sees humans (likely a caravan or patrol) arriving at the caravanserai; some are knights or dwarves who police the road.
18. RP – Aurelia chooses to remain present but not obvious, waiting to see if the newcomers approach.
19. SCENE – The patrol enters, searches the area, and eventually discovers Aurelia; they approach cautiously with swords drawn.
20. RP – Aurelia explains she is waiting for a caravan, as she was told one would arrive in a few days.
