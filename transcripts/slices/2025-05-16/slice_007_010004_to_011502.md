## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The party gathers near a gate by a river, with caravans inside a walled camp and a small fire burning. Trees have been felled nearby, and the group is joined by NPCs Sylvia and Lynn (first appearance).
2. SCENE – A large orc (first appearance) approaches the gate, accompanied by several young goblins ("Snotlings" or "Gits"), and knocks, demanding entry.
3. RP – The orc explains he is searching for missing children who were exploring the area and asks if the party knows anything.
4. RP – Aurelia (Katie) internally realizes the missing children are likely the three goblins she killed but chooses not to reveal this, attempting to remain unnoticed.
5. RP – Qotal (Erv) and Bruldin Grimstone (Michael) deny knowledge of the missing goblins and tell the orc to leave.
6. RP – The orc insists on entering, claiming the caravan has not paid a toll for passing through their territory.
7. RP – Bruldin asserts there is no toll and threatens the orc with his maul ("old Bessie").
8. RP – Qotal's tattoos begin to glow faintly, and he is told by another party member, "You are not welcome here. Leave now."
9. RP – The orc is surprised by Qotal's appearance, remarking on his green skin and questioning how the party acquired such an unusual companion.
10. RP – Arnór Josefson (Matthew) quotes, "It's not about the color of your skin but the content of your character."
11. RP – Bruldin threatens the orc again, slamming his maul against his hand.
12. RP – The orc, dropping any pretense of diplomacy, declares he will extract the toll by force and signals the start of combat.
13. ROLL – Initiative is rolled: Arnór (14), Aurelia (12, using Stealth), Qotal (15), Bruldin (not specified, but implied), Snotlings 1–2 (13), Snotlings 3–4 (20), Snotlings 5–6 (11), Orc Biggun (10).
14. COMBAT – Snotlings 3–4 move forward to attack the party as the gates are forced open by the orc's maul, breaking the chains and swinging the gates wide.
