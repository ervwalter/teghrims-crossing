## Chronological Events

1. RP – The party settles in for the night; Qotal (first appearance) is quiet and reserved, but hints he has more to share if prompted. Arnór Josefson (first appearance) is extroverted and initiates conversation about their reasons for traveling to Tegrim's Crossing.
2. RP – Aurelia (first appearance) is shy but willing to engage if spoken to. Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance) expresses excitement for battle and adventure, seeking a worthy death as a dwarven slayer.
3. RP – The group reflects on their recent battle with orcs and goblins, discussing what went well and what could be improved, such as missing attacks and being less rash.
4. RP – Each character shares their motivation for traveling to Tegrim's Crossing: Arnór seeks adventure and new experiences; Bruldin is drawn by the thrill of battle; Aurelia is investigating something for a friend; Qotal is following the mysterious echoes of a moss-eaten carving depicting a warrior with a broken blade, inspired by ancient runes from his homeland.
5. RP – NPC Lin (first appearance) explains he is seeking an abandoned shrine of great healing and divine power, possibly of Buddhist inspiration, hoping to restore it. NPC Sylvia (first appearance) reveals she is on family business, tasked with improving trade ties, and feels some resentment at being sent due to not being the eldest sibling.
6. SCENE – The party spends an uneventful night and continues their journey by caravan toward Tegrim's Crossing. The road is rough and slow, but the dwarven-built roads help.
7. SCENE – Several days pass uneventfully. Suddenly, while riding in their carts, the party hears shouting and the caravan begins to accelerate. Word spreads that the caravan is under attack.
8. SCENE – The party learns goblins are attacking the caravan. Initiative is called for.
9. ROLL – **Initiative:** Arnór rolls 24; Aurelia rolls 11; Qotal rolls 7. The party chooses their positions: Qotal and Bruldin in the front cart, Arnór and Aurelia in the back cart with the NPCs.
10. SCENE – The party is at the rear of the caravan, protecting the back. The wagons speed up, trying to outrun the goblins, who begin appearing alongside the caravan.
11. SCENE – The goblins are older, full-grown, and the party is warned that melee attacks will be difficult unless they have reach; falling off the cart is dangerous.
12. SCENE – The party is encouraged to use ranged attacks or creative skill checks during the encounter, as the carts are moving quickly and the goblins attack from the ground.
13. SCENE – It is clarified that Aurelia, as a dhampir, suffers no mechanical penalties from sunlight, though she is not fond of it. The party does not yet know her true nature.
14. SCENE – The goblins will act between rounds, but do not roll initiative. Arnór is first to act.
