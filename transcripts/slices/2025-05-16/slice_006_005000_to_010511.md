## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The caravan arrives at a new campsite after a long, tense day. The group is asked by the caravan leader to help secure the area for the night, with options to use various skills: enhancing goblin totems (Religion), repairing defenses (Crafting), setting traps (Survival), or communicating with animals (Nature).
2. ROLL – **Check:** Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance) rolls Athletics to drive stakes into the ground and create a defensive barrier → 21 – Success; he fortifies the entrances, making them painful for attackers to breach.
3. RP – Bruldin regales nearby workers with a tale, ending humorously about cursed gold and flat ale.
4. RP – Arnór Josefson (first appearance) asks if Religion can be used to create and enhance goblin totems.
5. ROLL – **Check:** Arnór Josefson rolls Religion to improve and multiply goblin totems → 22 – Success; the camp's perimeter is now lined with even creepier, more intimidating totems.
6. RP – The GM describes the totems as reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project, likely to scare off superstitious orcs and goblins.
7. RP – Aurelia (first appearance) decides to set up traps using Survival, moving outside the new stake barrier and closer to the forest, secretly conversing with an unseen friend.
8. ROLL – **Check:** Aurelia rolls Survival to set traps → 8 – Partial failure; the moist wood and weak vines cause most traps to fail, resulting in few effective snares.
9. RP – Qotal (first appearance) chooses to set up snares just inside the spikes, aiming to trip rather than injure intruders.
10. ROLL – **Check:** Qotal rolls Survival to set tripwires → Critical Success; he creates well-disguised, wicked tripwires around the area.
11. SCENE – NPCs Lin and Sylvia (first appearance for both) contribute: Lin spreads incense and performs prayers, while Sylvia oversees repairs to the camp's walls.
12. SCENE – The party organizes a night watch, with each member taking a shift. The camp is well-lit, and the mercenaries are experienced with such dangers.
13. SCENE – During the first watch, strange high-pitched squeaks and the sounds of tripping and cursing in an unknown language are heard at the back entrance.
14. RP – The party discusses language knowledge, deducing the intruders are speaking Goblinish, which some recognize from past encounters.
15. SCENE – The GM explains that goblins are a common threat in this region, while kobolds and skinks fill similar roles elsewhere.
16. RP – Bruldin, recognizing the goblin language, throws a javelin in their direction to intimidate them, shouting a warning.
17. ROLL – **Check:** Bruldin rolls Intimidation to scare off the goblins → 13 – Moderate success; the goblins react with yelps and a voice calls out in Common, demanding to know what's happening.
18. RP – Bruldin and the party hear a voice in Common from outside the camp, questioning their actions and mentioning missing "little guys."
19. SCENE – A large orc (first appearance) approaches the gate, accompanied by young goblins. The orc knocks and claims he is searching for missing children who were exploring the area.
20. RP – Aurelia quietly wonders if the missing goblins are the ones she killed earlier, but says nothing and tries to avoid notice.
21. RP – The party denies knowledge of the missing goblins and tells the orc to leave.
22. RP – The orc insists on entering to investigate and claims the caravan has not paid a toll for passing through their territory.
23. RP – Qotal firmly refuses, declaring the road is free and there is no toll for the orc.
