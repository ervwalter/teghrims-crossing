## Chronological Events

1. SCENE – The party is split between two carts at the rear of a caravan: Qotal (first appearance) and Bruldin Grimstone (first appearance) in the front cart, Aurelia (first appearance) and Arnór Josefson (first appearance) in the back cart, with two NPCs joining the back. The caravan is moving quickly, and goblins begin to emerge and attack.
2. SCENE – The party is tasked with defending the rear of the caravan as goblins attempt an ambush, using the terrain and speed of the carts to their advantage. Melee is discouraged due to the risk of being left behind.
3. RP – Brief discussion clarifies that dhampir (Aurelia) are not mechanically penalized by sunlight, though they are uncomfortable with positive energy.
4. SCENE – Initiative is established; the encounter will be handled as a series of skill check rounds, with ranged attacks and creative actions encouraged due to the moving carts.
5. ROLL – **Cast Spell:** Arnór Josefson casts Nudge Fate on an ally.
6. ROLL – **Attack:** Arnór Josefson uses Needle Darts at the goblins → 19 vs AC – Hits; sprays darts, forcing goblins to duck and reducing their attack effectiveness.
7. ROLL – **Skill:** Qotal attempts to Intimidate the goblins ("Back off before we chop the livers outta you") → Dirty 20 vs Will – Succeeds; goblins are intimidated and wary.
8. ROLL – **Attack:** Aurelia takes potshots at the goblins with her crossbow → 15 vs AC – Accurate, but does not kill; helps keep goblins ducking for cover.
9. RP – Bruldin Grimstone crouches to make himself a harder target and keeps an eye on the driver to ensure the cart stays on course.
10. COMBAT – Goblins retaliate with slings; their attacks are less effective due to the party's actions, but:
    - Aurelia is hit for 3 points of damage.
    - Qotal is hit twice for a total of 5 points of damage.
    - Arnór Josefson is hit for 2 points of damage.
11. RP – The party discusses tactics and the limitations of their movement and abilities while on the carts.
12. ROLL – **Skill:** Arnór Josefson makes an Occultism check to intimidate the superstitious goblins by making the symbol of the evil eye → 20 vs DC – Succeeds; some goblins panic and flee, others hesitate.
13. ROLL – **Skill:** Qotal attempts to rally the front cart driver with Diplomacy ("I once got locked in a goblin stew... you must move on") → 14 vs DC – Partial success; the driver whips the horses and gains a little speed, increasing distance from the rear cart.
14. ROLL – **Skill:** Aurelia tries to intimidate the back cart driver to speed up → 14 vs DC – Partial success; the driver is frustrated but picks up a little speed.
15. RP – Bruldin Grimstone prepares to act, referencing Arnór as a "warlock" and bantering about class distinctions.
