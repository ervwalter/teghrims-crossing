## Ambiguities & Uncertainties

- Some NPCs/new allies ("Onarra," "Vierña," "Chuck," "Stripes," and "Old Man") need clarification or detail in future sessions.
- The exact spelling of “Teghrim’s Crossing” vs. “Tigrum’s Cross”/variants has been reconciled as the same locale per campaign memory, but variants persist.
- The full roster of NPCs in the caravan during various combat scenes is not exhaustively detailed in all slices.
- The status of “Dramatis Personae” mechanics and their tracked relationships is newly introduced; future implications to be seen.
- The "moss-eaten carving" central to Qotal’s quest requires further information.
- The specific mechanical details and party roles of some spirits, familiars, and summoned creatures (e.g., Knutfig, Vierña) remain unclear.
