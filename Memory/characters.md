title: Characters
description: |
  This memory file tracks all significant characters encountered throughout the campaign, including player characters, NPCs, and important faction members. Each entry includes essential details such as name, race, class/occupation, current location, relationship to the party, and notable characteristics. This file serves as the central repository for character information, helping maintain continuity in character interactions and development across sessions. Characters should be organized by category (PC, NPC, faction) and include cross-references to related locations, quests, and relationships.
